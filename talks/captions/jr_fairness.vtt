slide-1
0:00:09.900 --> 0:00:12.600
<v ->Hi, this is John Rochford.</v>

2
0:00:12.600 --> 0:00:15.460
It's my honor and privilege to present to you today,

3
0:00:15.460 --> 0:00:18.180
my talk title is AI Machine Learning,

4
0:00:18.180 --> 0:00:21.390
Bias and Garbage In, Bias and Garbage Out.

5
0:00:21.390 --> 0:00:24.620
I am the INDEX program director and a faculty member

6
0:00:24.620 --> 0:00:26.510
at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center,

7
0:00:26.510 --> 0:00:28.840
part of UMass Medical School.

8
0:00:28.840 --> 0:00:32.593
I'm an Invited Expert for the World Wide Web Consortium.

slide-2
0:00:35.210 --> 0:00:38.920
A little about me, I am legally blind.

10
0:00:38.920 --> 0:00:41.690
I trade privacy for utility.

11
0:00:41.690 --> 0:00:44.930
The 14 Alexas in my home enable me to control devices

12
0:00:44.930 --> 0:00:47.140
with interfaces I can't see.

13
0:00:47.140 --> 0:00:48.963
Hey Alexa, what time is it now?

14
0:00:50.640 --> 0:00:53.400
<v Alexa>I am tired of telling you what time it is.</v>

15
0:00:53.400 --> 0:00:55.170
Look at a clock.

16
0:00:55.170 --> 0:00:56.810
<v ->What's the heck Alexa!</v>

17
0:00:56.810 --> 0:00:58.790
And of course, she records to the cloud

18
0:00:58.790 --> 0:01:00.530
everything I say.

19
0:01:00.530 --> 0:01:04.310
I'm an AI researcher focused on ML text simplification,

20
0:01:04.310 --> 0:01:06.660
ML fairness and empowerment

21
0:01:06.660 --> 0:01:09.953
and I'm a 35-year developer of technology for the disabled.

slide-3
0:01:12.200 --> 0:01:14.430
These are some of the INDEX staff.

23
0:01:15.380 --> 0:01:17.240
We are from all over the world,

24
0:01:17.240 --> 0:01:21.200
we are speakers of 16 languages,

25
0:01:21.200 --> 0:01:23.553
we are women, we are the disabled.

slide-4
0:01:25.900 --> 0:01:27.500
A big INDEX project is creating

27
0:01:27.500 --> 0:01:31.380
easy-to-understand COVID-19 information worldwide.

28
0:01:31.380 --> 0:01:34.530
With our easy Text.AI startup,

29
0:01:34.530 --> 0:01:36.980
INDEX ML engineers and disabled staff

30
0:01:36.980 --> 0:01:39.360
are developing our ML model

31
0:01:39.360 --> 0:01:42.900
and using crowdsourcing to simplify COVID-19 texts

32
0:01:42.900 --> 0:01:46.430
from the websites of every country's governments.

33
0:01:47.700 --> 0:01:50.860
Simple COVID-19 texts will help huge populations

34
0:01:50.860 --> 0:01:55.380
of people with cognitive disabilities, low literacy,

35
0:01:55.380 --> 0:01:58.410
non-native language speakers and seniors

36
0:01:58.410 --> 0:02:00.243
make the world safe and healthy.

slide-5
0:02:04.130 --> 0:02:09.130
My presentation targets are ML Social Bias,

38
0:02:09.250 --> 0:02:12.320
why we should care, what we should do about it,

39
0:02:12.320 --> 0:02:14.140
how we can do it.

40
0:02:14.140 --> 0:02:15.360
And I hope to persuade you

41
0:02:15.360 --> 0:02:17.990
that for your machine learning efforts to be successful,

42
0:02:17.990 --> 0:02:21.733
their development and data must include disabled people.

slide-6
0:02:23.200 --> 0:02:26.640
But first, a shout out to Black Lives Matter.

44
0:02:26.640 --> 0:02:29.630
University of Toronto and MIT researchers

45
0:02:29.630 --> 0:02:32.660
found that every facial recognition system they tested

46
0:02:32.660 --> 0:02:35.480
performed better on lighter-skinned faces.

47
0:02:35.480 --> 0:02:37.430
That includes a one-in-three failure rate

48
0:02:37.430 --> 0:02:40.470
with identifying darker-skinned females.

49
0:02:40.470 --> 0:02:42.820
This is from the article, Gender Shades,

50
0:02:42.820 --> 0:02:44.830
Intersectional Accuracy Disparities

51
0:02:44.830 --> 0:02:46.983
and Commercial Gender Classification.

slide-7
0:02:48.770 --> 0:02:53.770
The author of that article, Joy has a TED talk.

53
0:02:54.130 --> 0:02:57.443
It's called How I'm Fighting Bias in Algorithms.

54
0:02:58.380 --> 0:03:00.450
And what she's showing here in the picture

55
0:03:00.450 --> 0:03:04.780
is that for her face to be recognized,

56
0:03:04.780 --> 0:03:06.690
she has to wear

57
0:03:06.690 --> 0:03:09.103
a mask of a white female.

slide-8
0:03:10.500 --> 0:03:11.397
Why care?

59
0:03:11.397 --> 0:03:13.347
Profound responsibility.

60
0:03:13.347 --> 0:03:15.297
“There's nothing artificial about AI.

61
0:03:15.297 --> 0:03:18.427
"It's inspired by people, it's created by people

62
0:03:18.427 --> 0:03:20.937
"and most importantly, it impacts people.

63
0:03:20.937 --> 0:03:22.377
"It is a powerful tool

64
0:03:22.377 --> 0:03:24.917
"we are only just beginning to understand

65
0:03:24.917 --> 0:03:27.610
"and that is a profound responsibility.”

66
0:03:27.610 --> 0:03:30.300
From the article Bias in, Bias out,

67
0:03:30.300 --> 0:03:34.523
the Stanford Scientist Out to Make AI Less White and Male.

slide-9
0:03:36.100 --> 0:03:38.810
Why care about machine learning fairness and disability?

69
0:03:39.720 --> 0:03:43.130
It's the most significant challenge of our time.

70
0:03:43.890 --> 0:03:47.730
If it doesn't work for all, nobody will trust it.

71
0:03:47.730 --> 0:03:52.250
The disabled are part of every segment of society.

72
0:03:52.250 --> 0:03:55.850
Thus, if we can solve the problem for the disabled,

73
0:03:55.850 --> 0:03:58.430
we can solve the problem for everyone.

slide-10
0:03:59.360 --> 0:04:00.193
Why care?

75
0:04:00.193 --> 0:04:01.627
What about you?

76
0:04:01.627 --> 0:04:03.867
“Bias in ML has been almost ubiquitous

77
0:04:03.867 --> 0:04:06.627
"when the application is involved in people

78
0:04:06.627 --> 0:04:08.747
"and it has already hurt the benefit of people

79
0:04:08.747 --> 0:04:12.717
"in minority groups or historically disadvantageous groups.

80
0:04:12.717 --> 0:04:14.537
"Not only people in minority groups

81
0:04:14.537 --> 0:04:18.167
"but everyone should care about the bias in AI.

82
0:04:18.167 --> 0:04:19.327
"If no one cares,

83
0:04:19.327 --> 0:04:21.647
"it is highly likely that the next person

84
0:04:21.647 --> 0:04:24.527
"who suffers from bias treatment is one of us.”

85
0:04:25.820 --> 0:04:27.160
From the article,

86
0:04:27.160 --> 0:04:29.543
A Tutorial in Fairness in machine learning.

slide-11
0:04:31.970 --> 0:04:34.747
Being smart can be a deficit in ML.

88
0:04:34.747 --> 0:04:38.397
“People who perform better on a test of pattern detection,

89
0:04:38.397 --> 0:04:40.707
"a measure of cognitive ability

90
0:04:40.707 --> 0:04:44.297
"are also quicker to form and apply stereotypes.

91
0:04:44.297 --> 0:04:45.130
"In other words,

92
0:04:45.130 --> 0:04:48.997
"being smart might put you at a greater risk of prejudice

93
0:04:48.997 --> 0:04:51.497
"but you can still fight against those instincts

94
0:04:51.497 --> 0:04:53.570
"by challenging your thinking

95
0:04:53.570 --> 0:04:56.190
"and getting to know people who aren't like you.”

96
0:04:56.190 --> 0:04:57.630
This is from the article,

97
0:04:57.630 --> 0:05:00.393
Smart People Are More Likely To Stereotype.

slide-12
0:05:02.880 --> 0:05:05.860
How can you get to know people who aren't like you?

99
0:05:05.860 --> 0:05:09.553
Include the disabled in machine learning development.

100
0:05:10.857 --> 0:05:12.957
“To ensure AI-based systems

101
0:05:12.957 --> 0:05:15.627
"are treating people with disabilities fairly,

102
0:05:15.627 --> 0:05:17.667
"it is essential to include them

103
0:05:17.667 --> 0:05:19.567
"in the development process.”

104
0:05:21.100 --> 0:05:22.290
This is from the article,

105
0:05:22.290 --> 0:05:26.163
How to tackle AI Bias For People With Disabilities.

slide-13
0:05:27.917 --> 0:05:31.687
Here's an MIT failure to include the disabled.

107
0:05:31.687 --> 0:05:35.657
An MIT project claimed to translate American Sign Language

108
0:05:35.657 --> 0:05:38.697
with machine learning and sign-language gloves.

109
0:05:38.697 --> 0:05:40.307
It failed because sign language

110
0:05:40.307 --> 0:05:42.667
is much more than communicating with hands.

111
0:05:42.667 --> 0:05:46.127
It's about body language and facial expressions.

112
0:05:46.127 --> 0:05:48.207
MIT would have known that was essential,

113
0:05:48.207 --> 0:05:51.680
had it involved the deaf community.

114
0:05:51.680 --> 0:05:52.570
From the article,

115
0:05:52.570 --> 0:05:55.843
Why Sign-Language Gloves Don't Help Deaf People.

slide-14
0:05:57.357 --> 0:06:00.257
A big issue is lack of data from the disabled

117
0:06:00.257 --> 0:06:02.183
due to privacy concerns.

118
0:06:03.370 --> 0:06:06.377
Many of us do not disclose our disabilities.

119
0:06:06.377 --> 0:06:10.747
When we do, we are denied employment, housing and more.

120
0:06:10.747 --> 0:06:14.970
Thus, despite being 15% of the population,

121
0:06:14.970 --> 0:06:17.473
we are significantly underrepresented in training data.

slide-15
0:06:19.137 --> 0:06:22.547
What can we do about a lack of data from the disabled?

123
0:06:22.547 --> 0:06:24.687
Accurate analysis.

124
0:06:24.687 --> 0:06:26.747
“We are helping machine learning engineers,

125
0:06:26.747 --> 0:06:29.857
"figure out what questions to ask of their data,

126
0:06:29.857 --> 0:06:31.987
"to diagnose why their systems

127
0:06:31.987 --> 0:06:34.510
"may be making unfair predictions.”

128
0:06:34.510 --> 0:06:35.660
This is from the article,

129

MIT Researchers Show How To Detect and Address

130
0:06:39.260 --> 0:06:41.763
AI Bias Without Loss in Accuracy.

slide-16
0:06:43.367 --> 0:06:44.737
What can we do with data

132
0:06:44.737 --> 0:06:47.397
we do have from the disabled?

133
0:06:47.397 --> 0:06:49.687
Fairness through unawareness:

134
0:06:49.687 --> 0:06:52.367
“No information about protected attributes,

135
0:06:52.367 --> 0:06:55.857
"e.g gender, age, disability is gathered

136
0:06:55.857 --> 0:06:58.527
"and used in the decision-making.

137
0:06:58.527 --> 0:07:00.647
Fairness through awareness:

138
0:07:00.647 --> 0:07:03.797
"Membership in a protected group is explicitly known

139
0:07:03.797 --> 0:07:06.207
"and fairness can be formally defined,

140
0:07:06.207 --> 0:07:09.540
"tested, and enforced algorithmically.”

141
0:07:09.540 --> 0:07:10.640
This is from the article,

142
0:07:10.640 --> 0:07:13.993
AI Fairness For People With Disabilities Point of View.

slide-17
0:07:15.770 --> 0:07:18.200
What can we do to mitigate our lack of data

144
0:07:18.200 --> 0:07:19.417
from the disabled?

145
0:07:19.417 --> 0:07:22.627
One possibility is to use synthetic data.

146
0:07:22.627 --> 0:07:25.167
“Given a data set involving a protected attribute

147
0:07:25.167 --> 0:07:27.947
"with a privileged and unprivileged group,

148
0:07:27.947 --> 0:07:30.770
"we create an ideal world data set.

149
0:07:30.770 --> 0:07:31.747
"For every data sample,

150
0:07:31.747 --> 0:07:35.270
"we create a new sample having the same features

151
0:07:35.270 --> 0:07:37.187
"except the protected attributes

152
0:07:37.187 --> 0:07:39.687
"and label as the original sample

153
0:07:39.687 --> 0:07:43.380
"but with the opposite protected attribute value.”

slide-18
0:07:51.490 --> 0:07:55.307
What tools will help us implement machine learning fairness?

158
0:07:55.307 --> 0:07:57.127
Well there are commercial tools,

159
0:07:57.127 --> 0:07:59.307
many companies such as Microsoft,

160
0:07:59.307 --> 0:08:03.497
Amazon, IBM offer bias mitigation services

161
0:08:03.497 --> 0:08:05.133
in their ML platforms.

162
0:08:05.997 --> 0:08:07.827
There are open source tools.

163
0:08:07.827 --> 0:08:11.117
There are an increasing number on GitHub.

164
0:08:11.117 --> 0:08:13.653
The following are the best of the current ones.

167
0:08:18.827 --> 0:08:22.417
of trained machine learning models with minimal coding.

168
0:08:22.417 --> 0:08:24.667
This interface looks pretty cool to me

169
0:08:24.667 --> 0:08:26.323

Final thought about disability,

188
0:09:27.460 --> 0:09:29.830
there is a saying we shout from the rooftops

189
0:09:29.830 --> 0:09:31.700
for all to hear.

190
0:09:31.700 --> 0:09:32.747
I hope you do.

191
0:09:32.747 --> 0:09:35.157
