slide-1
00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:11.456
<v ->Hi, everyone.</v>

2
00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:14.226
This talk is about ONNX.js,

3
00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:16.736
which is a JavaScript library

4
00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:21.069
to run ONNX model in a browser and Node.js.

5
00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:24.499
This is Emma from Microsoft.

6
00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:27.899
Slide two.

slide-2
00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:33.346
JavaScript is one of the most important languages.

8
00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:36.973
As a web technology survey reports,

9
00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:41.973
JavaScript is used by 95% of websites,

10
00:00:42.056 --> 00:00:43.746
and it tops the list

11
00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:46.679
of the most popular client-side languages.

12
00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:51.197
Another important scenario using JavaScript

13
00:00:51.197 --> 00:00:53.224
is Electron apps.

14
00:00:53.224 --> 00:00:58.224
Electron enables you to create desktop applications

15
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:02.666
with pure JavaScript by providing a runtime

16
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.009
with rich native APIs.

17
00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:08.346
If you can build a website,

18
00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:12.359
you can build a desktop app with Electron.

19
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.476
There are a lot of well-known apps built with Electron,

20
00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:23.176
Slack, VS code and GitHub desktop.

21
00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:27.546
All of them are done with Node.js through Electron,

22
00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:29.939
and the experience is pretty good.

23
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.056
Same as websites,

24
00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.316
Electron apps are cross-platform,

25
00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:40.299
compatible with Mac, Windows and Linux.

26
00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:43.949
Slide Three.

slide-3
00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:48.546
As you know, machine learning has been widely used

28
00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:51.906
for improving product experience.

29
00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:54.056
Can we run machine learning with JavaScript

30
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.249
in client-side applications?

31
00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:01.266
Originally, people have some concern

32
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:04.896
given that JavaScript isn't designed

33
00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:07.996
for high performance computing

34
00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:11.406
and machine learning requires significant computation

35
00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:15.079
when executing neural network model.

36
00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.666
Actually, there are a lot of good techniques

37
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:21.176
to make JavaScript and machine learning

38
00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:23.036
work quite well together

39
00:02:23.036 --> 00:02:26.946
for developing more engaging and advanced

40
00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.349
client-side AI capabilities.

41
00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:32.656
Then, there are some well-known benefits

42
00:02:32.656 --> 00:02:35.576
of using client-side machine learning,

43
00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:37.876
like privacy protection.

44
00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:40.986
Since client-side models work offline,

45
00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:44.056
user do not need to worry about their data

46
00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:47.746
being sent across the Internet.

47
00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:49.976
Realtime analysis,

48
00:02:49.976 --> 00:02:53.176
although client-side hardware may be slow,

49
00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:55.416
it's almost certainly faster

50
00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:59.116
than waiting to retrieve results from a server

51
00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:03.619
when user need to uploading big data in a bad network.

52
00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:08.609
It makes livestream video analysis possible.

53
00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:12.966
Even with no connection to Internet,

54
00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:17.149
client-side machine learning experience wouldn't be broken.

55
00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:21.106
When client-side AI applications

56
00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:23.049
are developed with JavaScript,

57
00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:27.116
AI developers can easily enable

58
00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:31.171
consistent AI experience cross-platform,

59
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:35.316
accelerate performance by utilizing GPUs

60
00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:38.456
and distribute the experience to users

61
00:03:38.456 --> 00:03:41.136
without asking for any libraries

62
00:03:41.136 --> 00:03:42.849
and drivers installation.

63
00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:47.509
Slide four.

slide-4
00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:51.636
Similar to tensorflow.js,

65
00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:55.956
ONNX.js is another framework to provide capability

66
00:03:55.956 --> 00:03:59.726
of running machine learning models with JavaScript.

67
00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:04.706
Model format ONNX.js support is ONNX.

68
00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:09.189
So allow me to give a brief introduction of ONNX first.

69
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.186
ONNX stands for open neural network exchange,

70
00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:15.976
is an open standard

71
00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:19.176
for representing machine learning models.

72
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.536
As a standard,

73
00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:22.996
it defines three things,

74
00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:26.356
an extensible computation graph,

75
00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:31.086
standard data types, and built-in operators.

76
00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:33.839
Here is an example of ONNX model.

77
00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:36.726
The spec supports

78
00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:40.239
both DNN and traditional machine learning models.

79
00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:43.719
Slide five.

slide-5
00:04:44.906 --> 00:04:46.566
As an open standard,

81
00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:50.976
the beauty of ONNX is framework interoperability.

82
00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:54.296
As long as a model is trained through a framework

83
00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:56.116
which supports ONNX,

84
00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:59.009
you can convert that model to ONNX format.

85
00:05:00.306 --> 00:05:02.926
Here are some of the popular frameworks

86
00:05:02.926 --> 00:05:05.386
that support ONNX conversion.

87
00:05:05.386 --> 00:05:09.176
For some of these like PyTorch,

88
00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:13.336
ONNX format export is built in natively,

89
00:05:13.336 --> 00:05:17.348
and for others like tensorflow Keras,

90
00:05:17.348 --> 00:05:20.056
there are separate installable package

91
00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:21.729
that can handle conversion.

92
00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:27.436
There is already support for many popular models,

93
00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:31.939
including object detection like Fast R-CNN,

94
00:05:32.976 --> 00:05:36.206
speech recognition and NLP

95
00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:39.439
including brute and other transformers.

96
00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:43.969
Slide six.

slide-6
00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:48.893
Since ONNX community was established in 2017

98
00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:52.816
by Microsoft and Facebook,

99
00:05:52.816 --> 00:05:57.056
it has been attracting more and more companies to join.

100
00:05:57.056 --> 00:06:02.056
Today, the ONNX community is made up of over 40 companies.

101
00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:08.536
Last year, ONNX project was accepted into Linux Foundation

102
00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:13.146
as a graduated project.

103
00:06:13.146 --> 00:06:17.576
This is a key milestone in establishing ONNX

104
00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:21.069
as a vendor-neutral open format standard.

105
00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:25.969
Slide seven.

slide-7
00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:31.956
ONNX.js is pure JavaScript implementation of ONNX framework

107
00:06:32.736 --> 00:06:35.586
which allows user to run ONNX models

108
00:06:35.586 --> 00:06:37.929
in a browser and Node.js.

109
00:06:39.036 --> 00:06:43.536
ONNX.js optimize model inference on both CPU and GPU

110
00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:48.536
by leveraging several advanced techniques.

111
00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:50.529
I will talk about the detail later.

112
00:06:51.496 --> 00:06:53.236
The graph on the left

113
00:06:53.236 --> 00:06:57.276
is the high-level architecture of ONNX.js.

114
00:06:57.276 --> 00:07:00.536
Graph engine will load ONNX model file,

115
00:07:00.536 --> 00:07:03.299
then interpret it to your model DAG,

116
00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:09.506
then execution engine will call appropriate backend

117
00:07:09.826 --> 00:07:12.769
to execute the model, to get the output.

118
00:07:14.036 --> 00:07:16.656
There are three backends enabled,

119
00:07:16.656 --> 00:07:21.409
two for CPU using JavaScript and WebAssembly separately,

120
00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:24.779
one for GPU using WebGL.

121
00:07:26.296 --> 00:07:31.296
Also ONNX.js provides profiler, logger and other utilities

122
00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:35.539
for easily debugging and analysis.

123
00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:43.756
Except Firefox on Android,

124
00:07:43.756 --> 00:07:48.426
ONNX.js supports all browsers on major platforms.

125
00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:51.996
So you can easily build up your AI applications

126
00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:54.639
across platform with ONNX.js.

slide-8
00:07:58.346 --> 00:08:00.366
For running on CPU,

128
00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:05.366
ONNX.js adopts WebAssembly to accelerate the model

129
00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:06.939
at near-native speed.

130
00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:11.786
WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed

131
00:08:11.786 --> 00:08:14.776
by taking advantage of common hardware capabilities

132
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:19.319
available on a wide range of platform.

133
00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:25.396
It's generally much faster than JavaScript

134
00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:29.676
for heavy workloads in a machine learning task.

135
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:34.676
JavaScript is dynamically typed and garbage-collected,

136
00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:40.036
which can cause significantly slow down at runtime.

137
00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:42.959
Based on our evaluation, compared to JavaScript,

138
00:08:44.216 --> 00:08:48.789
WebAssembly can improve the performance by over 11 times.

139
00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:55.716
We have enabled WebAssembly as one CPU backend

140
00:08:55.716 --> 00:08:58.679
since ONNX.js was open sourced in 2018.

141
00:09:01.636 --> 00:09:06.636
One year later, tensorflow.js started exploring WebAssembly.

142
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.416
Furthermore, ONNX.js utilize a web worker

143
00:09:12.416 --> 00:09:15.476
to provide multi-thread environment

144
00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:17.919
for operator parallelization.

145
00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:21.896
Originally, web worker was introduced

146
00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:25.296
to unblock UI rendering.

147
00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:29.646
It allows you to create additional thread

148
00:09:29.646 --> 00:09:33.859
to run other long-run computation separately.

149
00:09:35.332 --> 00:09:40.026
ONNX.js leverages web worker to enable parallelization

150
00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.086
with heavy operators,

151
00:09:42.086 --> 00:09:45.216
which significantly improve the performance

152
00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:47.493
on machines with multicores.

153
00:09:49.766 --> 00:09:54.766
By taking full advantage of WebAssembly and web worker,

154
00:09:55.276 --> 00:10:00.276
the final result shows over 19 times speedup

155
00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:03.529
on CPU with four cores.

156
00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:08.249
Slide nine.

slide-9
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:13.466
WebGL is adopted for GPU acceleration.

158
00:10:13.466 --> 00:10:18.466
WebGL is a popular standard for accessing GPU capabilities.

159
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:21.666
It's a JavaScript API

160
00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:26.266
for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics

161
00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:28.729
within any compatible web browser.

162
00:10:30.086 --> 00:10:32.676
WebGL is based on OpenGL,

163
00:10:32.676 --> 00:10:37.039
which provides direct access to a computer's GPU.

164
00:10:39.196 --> 00:10:41.276
Graphics creation in JavaScript

165
00:10:41.276 --> 00:10:43.656
is similar to machine learning,

166
00:10:43.656 --> 00:10:46.946
because it requires fast processing power

167
00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:50.829
to animate and draw detailed vectors.

168
00:10:52.236 --> 00:10:57.236
Based on WebGL, ONNX.js enable many optimizations

169
00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:01.756
for reducing data transfer between CPU and GPU,

170
00:11:01.756 --> 00:11:05.966
as well as reducing GPU processing cycle

171
00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:09.469
to further push the performance to the maximum.

172
00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:14.446
Here is a chart showing performance improvements

173
00:11:14.446 --> 00:11:18.256
along with some major optimizations.

174
00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:19.089
Finally,

175
00:11:19.089 --> 00:11:24.089
we were able to reduce the latency of ResNet50 on GPU

176
00:11:24.376 --> 00:11:26.339
by more than three times.

177
00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:31.769
Slide 10.

slide-10
00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:32.602
Okay.

179
00:11:32.602 --> 00:11:35.886
If you want to run a model with ONNX.js,

180
00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:37.936
here is end-to-end flow.

181
00:11:37.936 --> 00:11:42.419
You can train a model through any framework supporting ONNX,

182
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:47.866
convert it to ONNX format using public conversion tools,

183
00:11:47.866 --> 00:11:51.486
then you can inference the converted model with ONNX.js

184
00:11:51.486 --> 00:11:52.319
with this.

185
00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:56.039
Slide 11.

slide-11
00:11:56.946 --> 00:11:59.989
This is a HTML example to use ONNX.js,

187
00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:03.961
majorly three steps,

188
00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:07.378
create an ONNX session, a node ONNX model

189
00:12:08.396 --> 00:12:10.566
and generate inputs,

190
00:12:10.566 --> 00:12:12.709
then run the model with the session.run.

191
00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:16.309
Slide 12.

slide-12
00:12:17.276 --> 00:12:22.276
Also you can use NPM and bundling tools to use ONNX.js.

193
00:12:25.206 --> 00:12:26.039
Slide 13.

slide-13
00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:31.946
To demonstrate Web ML capability

195
00:12:31.946 --> 00:12:35.936
and help user ramp up with ONNX.js easily,

196
00:12:35.936 --> 00:12:39.149
we built up ONNX.js demo website.

197
00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:44.366
Five models are enabled on this website.

198
00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:48.333
Here is a example of running YOLO model in a browser.

199
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.826
You can choose different backend, CPU or GPU.

200
00:12:54.036 --> 00:12:57.046
Since YOLO is realtime neural network

201
00:12:57.046 --> 00:12:58.946
for object detection,

202
00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:00.996
in addition to image detection,

203
00:13:00.996 --> 00:13:04.566
we implemented a realtime detection scenario

204
00:13:04.566 --> 00:13:06.449
through your local camera.

205
00:13:10.176 --> 00:13:11.699
Slide 14.

slide-14
00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:15.486
ONNX.js is evolving

207
00:13:15.486 --> 00:13:19.186
and we'd love to embrace your contribution.

208
00:13:19.186 --> 00:13:23.009
Here are three major buckets to make ONNX.js better.

209
00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:28.896
Currently, ONNX.js support limited ONNX operators,

210
00:13:28.896 --> 00:13:32.749
we need to catch up with evolving ONNX spec.

211
00:13:34.622 --> 00:13:36.796
There are still a lot of opportunities

212
00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:39.519
to further optimize ONNX.js performance.

213
00:13:40.456 --> 00:13:44.366
For example, WebNN, web neural network,

214
00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:48.469
is one well promising tech ONNX can integrate.

215
00:13:49.646 --> 00:13:51.546
Some experimental results

216
00:13:51.546 --> 00:13:54.939
have already showed very good performance gain.

217
00:13:56.156 --> 00:14:01.156
Lastly, more demos can help attract more users

218
00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:04.459
by promoting ONNX.js capabilities.

slide-15
00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:11.446
Okay.

220
00:14:11.446 --> 00:14:13.316
That's the end.

221
00:14:13.316 --> 00:14:15.486
Hope you enjoy this talk.

222
00:14:15.486 --> 00:14:16.319
Thanks.
