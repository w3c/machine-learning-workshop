Slide 1.

2
0:00:10.120 --> 0:00:13.400
I’m Bernard Aboba,

3
0:00:13.400 --> 0:00:19.240
presenting on behalf of the Chairs of the WebRTC Working Group:

4
0:00:19.240 --> 0:00:27.360
myself, Harald Alvestrand and Jan-Ivar Bruaroey

5
0:00:27.360 --> 0:00:33.360
on the topic of Machine Learning and Web Media.

7
0:00:33.360 --> 0:00:36.000
Slide 2.

slide-2
0:00:36.000 --> 0:00:40.440
The Pandemic of 2020 has been a pivotal moment for the world,

9
0:00:40.440 --> 0:00:45.600
with many institutions experiencing unprecedented stress.

10
0:00:45.600 --> 0:00:49.120
Amidst all the tragedy, we have seen an unparalleled level of

11
0:00:49.120 --> 0:00:52.920
user-driven innovation as consumers and businesses

12
0:00:52.920 --> 0:00:57.840
struggle to survive and perhaps even thrive,

13
0:00:57.840 --> 0:01:02.480
leading to a decade’s worth of innovation in only a few months,

14
0:01:02.480 --> 0:01:10.480
in areas as diverse as politics, art, entertainment and sports.

15
0:01:10.480 --> 0:01:16.560
Yogi Berra said, “you can observe a lot, just by watching”.

16
0:01:16.560 --> 0:01:26.200
What have you observed?  Here are some of the things in my scrapbook.

18
0:01:26.200 --> 0:01:29.600
Slide 3.

slide-3
0:01:29.600 --> 0:01:36.440
Live theatre has been particularly hard hit during the pandemic.

20
0:01:36.440 --> 0:01:41.320
Rather than cancelling their 2020-2021 season,

21
0:01:41.320 --> 0:01:50.640
Tacoma Little Theatre has chosen to move it online.

22
0:01:50.640 --> 0:01:54.160
Their first online production, of “Robin Hood”,

23
0:01:54.160 --> 0:01:57.600
utilized custom backgrounds for scenery,

24
0:01:57.600 --> 0:02:01.200
combining conferencing (for the live production)

25
0:02:01.200 --> 0:02:05.120
with Youtube for archiving and subsequent streaming.

26
0:02:05.120 --> 0:02:10.440
Typically, custom backgrounds are implemented

27
0:02:10.440 --> 0:02:13.400
using machine learning algorithms

28
0:02:13.400 --> 0:02:16.280
that locally operate on captured video,

29
0:02:16.280 --> 0:02:19.160
extracting human forms which are then overlaid

30
0:02:19.160 --> 0:02:28.640
on the selected backgrounds before being encoded for transmission.

32
0:02:28.640 --> 0:02:32.600
Slide 4.

slide-4
0:02:32.600 --> 0:02:35.480
During the pandemic, sporting matches have had

34
0:02:35.480 --> 0:02:39.400
to be conducted in the absence of fans.

35
0:02:39.400 --> 0:02:45.800
To incorporate fans back into the game,

36
0:02:45.800 --> 0:02:48.600
the NBA collaborated with Microsoft

37
0:02:48.600 --> 0:02:52.920
to introduce “Together Mode” where video from fans

38
0:02:52.920 --> 0:02:55.920
are combined so as to make it seem

39
0:02:55.920 --> 0:02:59.600
like they are viewing the game courtside.

40
0:02:59.600 --> 0:03:00.960
As with the previous example,

41
0:03:00.960 --> 0:03:05.320
this one involves machine learning algorithms operating locally

42
0:03:05.320 --> 0:03:09.240
on captured video prior to encoding and transmission

43
0:03:09.240 --> 0:03:13.880
to a server producing a composite video

44
0:03:13.880 --> 0:03:20.520
including both the fans as well as the game.

46
0:03:20.520 --> 0:03:23.640
Slide 5.

slide-5
0:03:23.640 --> 0:03:26.400
Machine learning algorithms in these use cases

48
0:03:26.400 --> 0:03:32.320
operate on captured media  prior to encoding or transmission.

49
0:03:32.320 --> 0:03:36.240
For audio, machine learning can be used for noise suppression,

50
0:03:36.240 --> 0:03:39.120
and for video it might provide for background removal,

51
0:03:39.120 --> 0:03:42.640
“together mode”, or “funny hats”.

52
0:03:42.640 --> 0:03:45.680
Processing may also occur

53
0:03:45.680 --> 0:03:49.400
on a centralized server acting as a receiver,

54
0:03:49.400 --> 0:03:53.440
such as production of a composite video.

55
0:03:53.440 --> 0:03:54.680
On the local system,

56
0:03:54.680 --> 0:03:58.000
one proposal for obtaining access to raw video

57
0:03:58.000 --> 0:04:01.880
is to add a method on a MediaStreamTrack.

59
0:04:01.880 --> 0:04:07.160
Slide 6.

slide-6
0:04:07.160 --> 0:04:09.880
APIs that provide access to encoded media

61
0:04:09.880 --> 0:04:14.400
such as Insertable Streams and WebCodecs

62
0:04:14.400 --> 0:04:18.280
operate at a different place in the pipeline,

63
0:04:18.280 --> 0:04:21.280
after encoding (on the sender)

64
0:04:21.280 --> 0:04:25.360
or prior to decode (on the receiver).

66
0:04:25.360 --> 0:04:31.280
Since raw video is considerably larger than encoded video,

67
0:04:31.280 --> 0:04:33.280
and the processing can be quite different,

68
0:04:33.280 --> 0:04:37.520
the performance of a Transform stream operating

69
0:04:37.520 --> 0:04:42.320
on encoded media within Insertable Streams

70
0:04:42.320 --> 0:04:47.000
may not be sufficient for machine learning algorithms

71
0:04:47.000 --> 0:04:49.680
operating on raw media.

73
0:04:49.680 --> 0:04:53.640
Slide 7.

slide-7
0:04:53.640 --> 0:05:00.400
Performance across the pipeline is an important requirement:

75
0:05:00.400 --> 0:05:06.400
capture, application of machine learning models,

76
0:05:06.400 --> 0:05:10.720
encoding and transmission.

77
0:05:10.720 --> 0:05:13.160
It is desirable for each pipeline stage

78
0:05:13.160 --> 0:05:17.680
to operate on buffers provided by the previous stage,

79
0:05:17.680 --> 0:05:20.960
avoiding memory copies.

80
0:05:20.960 --> 0:05:23.960
For example, if the capture device can provide buffers

81
0:05:23.960 --> 0:05:28.200
to the machine learning algorithm (perhaps a GPU buffer?)

82
0:05:28.200 --> 0:05:32.400
without extraneous copies.

83
0:05:32.400 --> 0:05:34.560
After processing by machine learning algorithms,

84
0:05:34.560 --> 0:05:36.640
WebCodecs would encode

85
0:05:36.640 --> 0:05:40.400
and WebTransport would perform network I/O,

86
0:05:40.400 --> 0:05:44.240
also ideally without extraneous copies.

88
0:05:47.800 --> 0:05:49.240
Slide 8.

slide-8
0:05:49.240 --> 0:05:51.920
The Insertable Streams and WebCodecs proposals

90
0:05:51.920 --> 0:05:54.920
share data structures such as

91
0:05:54.920 --> 0:05:58.440
the representation of audio and video frames.

92
0:05:58.440 --> 0:06:03.360
So even though WebCodecs does not use the WHATWG Streams API

93
0:06:03.360 --> 0:06:06.880
used by Insertable Streams and WebTransport,

94
0:06:06.880 --> 0:06:08.560
WebCodecs is still leveraging

95
0:06:08.560 --> 0:06:13.120
the Insertable Streams implementation experience.

97
0:06:13.120 --> 0:06:16.880
Slide 9.

slide-9
0:06:16.880 --> 0:06:23.400
A few words about AV1 support in realtime communications.

99
0:06:23.400 --> 0:06:27.440
AV1 offers not only improved compression efficiency

100
0:06:27.440 --> 0:06:32.680
but also a new image format (AVIF)

101
0:06:32.680 --> 0:06:36.240
likely to be widely adopted in browsers.

102
0:06:36.240 --> 0:06:38.720
The higher encoding complexity of AV1

103
0:06:38.720 --> 0:06:43.200
makes performance considerations particularly important,

104
0:06:43.200 --> 0:06:49.360
but there are proposals to enable software encoders to be practical

105
0:06:49.360 --> 0:06:52.640
before hardware acceleration becomes widely available.

106
0:06:52.640 --> 0:06:56.240
These include capability advertisement

107
0:06:56.240 --> 0:07:01.280
to allows AV1 to be only used for decode;

108
0:07:01.280 --> 0:07:02.920
mixed-codec simulcast,

109
0:07:02.920 --> 0:07:07.520
allowing AV1 to be used to encode low bitrate video

110
0:07:07.520 --> 0:07:10.440
with other codecs used for higher bitrate encodings;

111
0:07:10.440 --> 0:07:14.240
content-hints, allowing AV1 to be used

112
0:07:14.240 --> 0:07:18.360
for screen content coding (often at low framerates),

113
0:07:18.360 --> 0:07:20.480
and scalable video coding.

115
0:07:20.480 --> 0:07:23.560
Slide 10.

slide-10
0:07:23.560 --> 0:07:26.720

on the presentation and helped put it together.
