slide-1
0:00:09.600 --> 0:00:10.940
<v ->Hello, everyone. My name is Jason Mayes,</v>

2
0:00:10.940 --> 0:00:12.190
I am the developer advocate

3
0:00:12.190 --> 0:00:14.270
for TensorFlow.js here at Google,

4
0:00:14.270 --> 0:00:15.410
and today we'd like to talk to you

5
0:00:15.410 --> 0:00:17.500
about some of the opportunities and challenges

6
0:00:17.500 --> 0:00:20.900
we've seen, whilst creating and maintaining TensorFlow.js,

7
0:00:20.900 --> 0:00:22.200
and we believe these things will be applicable

8
0:00:22.200 --> 0:00:23.387
to the wider Machine Learning

9
0:00:23.387 --> 0:00:25.443
and JavaScript community as well.

10
0:00:26.510 --> 0:00:27.730
So let's get started.

11
0:00:27.730 --> 0:00:28.650
Next slide.

slide-2
0:00:28.650 --> 0:00:30.410
Now, for those of you who are not aware about us,

13
0:00:30.410 --> 0:00:32.370
essentially TensorFlow.js is an open source

14
0:00:32.370 --> 0:00:33.930
Machine Learning Library,

15
0:00:33.930 --> 0:00:35.810
that is built in JavaScript.

16
0:00:35.810 --> 0:00:37.800
It allows you to do machine learning in the browser,

17
0:00:37.800 --> 0:00:38.910
on the client-side,

18
0:00:38.910 --> 0:00:40.390
which means you have lower latency,

19
0:00:40.390 --> 0:00:43.330
higher privacy, and lower serving cost of course.

20
0:00:43.330 --> 0:00:45.850
And we also support other environments such as Node.js,

21
0:00:45.850 --> 0:00:48.600
which means we can execute in a whole bunch of places.

slide-3
0:00:48.600 --> 0:00:50.120
And in fact, if we look at the next slide,

23
0:00:50.120 --> 0:00:52.350
you can see all the environments we run.

24
0:00:52.350 --> 0:00:53.550
And the reason I bring this up,

25
0:00:53.550 --> 0:00:55.770
is because when we're defining web standards,

26
0:00:55.770 --> 0:00:56.950
often these things trickle

27
0:00:56.950 --> 0:00:59.650
into these other environments as well.

28
0:00:59.650 --> 0:01:01.510
So, we've got all the common web browsers there,

29
0:01:01.510 --> 0:01:04.200
but also, Node.js on the back end,

30
0:01:04.200 --> 0:01:05.930
React Native for mobile native apps.

31
0:01:05.930 --> 0:01:08.450
We've got Electron for desktop native apps,

32
0:01:08.450 --> 0:01:10.960
and of course Raspberry Pi for Internet of Things,

33
0:01:10.960 --> 0:01:13.540
which we can access via Node.js.

34
0:01:13.540 --> 0:01:16.200
So, I just want to be mindful when we are thinking

35
0:01:16.200 --> 0:01:17.540
about ideas today

36
0:01:17.540 --> 0:01:18.790
that we are aware

37
0:01:18.790 --> 0:01:21.370
that these things could trickle through to these other areas

38
0:01:21.370 --> 0:01:23.800
when people try to use machine learning in JavaScript

39
0:01:23.800 --> 0:01:25.890
in these environments as well.

40
0:01:25.890 --> 0:01:27.110
Next slide.

slide-4
0:01:27.110 --> 0:01:28.570
So for those of you who are not familiar

42
0:01:28.570 --> 0:01:29.880
with our architecture,

43
0:01:29.880 --> 0:01:31.690
this is the current stack.

44
0:01:31.690 --> 0:01:32.880
Right now we have a bunch of pre-made models

45
0:01:32.880 --> 0:01:34.550
that sit at the very top there,

46
0:01:34.550 --> 0:01:37.500
that are super easy to use JavaScript classes.

47
0:01:37.500 --> 0:01:39.460
Just below this, we have a Layers API,

48
0:01:39.460 --> 0:01:40.890
which is a high level API

49
0:01:40.890 --> 0:01:42.950
to allow you to do machine learning more easily,

50
0:01:42.950 --> 0:01:45.130
which is very similar to Keras in Python,

51
0:01:45.130 --> 0:01:46.683
if you're familiar with that.

52
0:01:47.740 --> 0:01:50.230
Below these we have our core and Ops API,

53
0:01:50.230 --> 0:01:52.300
which is the more mathematical layer,

54
0:01:52.300 --> 0:01:54.400
so allows you to do the things like linear algebra,

55
0:01:54.400 --> 0:01:56.000
and so on and so forth.

56
0:01:56.000 --> 0:01:57.990
And this can talk to different environments,

57
0:01:57.990 --> 0:02:00.460
such as the client-side or the server-side.

58
0:02:00.460 --> 0:02:02.250
Now if you just focus on the client-side for a second,

59
0:02:02.250 --> 0:02:04.800
you can see things like the browser,

60
0:02:04.800 --> 0:02:05.980
WeChat, React Native sitting over there,

61
0:02:05.980 --> 0:02:08.400
and each one of these environments understands

62
0:02:08.400 --> 0:02:10.670
how to talk to different back-ends,

63
0:02:10.670 --> 0:02:14.890
such as the CPU, WebGL or web assembly.

64
0:02:14.890 --> 0:02:17.100
Now, of course the CPU is always available,

65
0:02:17.100 --> 0:02:19.660
but it's the slowest form of execution.

66
0:02:19.660 --> 0:02:21.100
If a graphics card is available,

67
0:02:21.100 --> 0:02:23.900
we can leverage WebGL to get higher performance

68
0:02:23.900 --> 0:02:24.480
on the graphics card,

69
0:02:24.480 --> 0:02:26.200
and if web assembly is available,

70
0:02:26.200 --> 0:02:28.340
we can leverage high performance on the CPU,

71
0:02:28.340 --> 0:02:30.673
by utilizing low level instructions.

72
0:02:31.860 --> 0:02:33.200
Now,

73
0:02:33.200 --> 0:02:35.370
it should also be noted people can also convert models

74
0:02:35.370 --> 0:02:39.320
from Python into JavaScript using our converters,

75
0:02:39.320 --> 0:02:41.450
as you can see on the left-hand side,

76
0:02:41.450 --> 0:02:42.840
and this is something to bear in mind

77
0:02:42.840 --> 0:02:45.560
because people might try and load larger models

78
0:02:45.560 --> 0:02:48.453
or more complex models in the future via this method.

79
0:02:49.490 --> 0:02:51.800
Next slide.

slide-5
0:02:51.800 --> 0:02:53.800
Now we see three key user journeys right now,

81
0:02:53.800 --> 0:02:56.250
when people are using TensorFlow.js.

82
0:02:56.250 --> 0:02:58.910
First one is the ability to run models that are pre-trained,

83
0:02:58.910 --> 0:03:01.860
that's the easiest route and what people often start with.

84
0:03:01.860 --> 0:03:03.770
People then choose to try and retrain their models

85
0:03:03.770 --> 0:03:05.490
by transfer learning as their next step

86
0:03:05.490 --> 0:03:07.570
to work with their own custom data,

87
0:03:07.570 --> 0:03:09.700
and then of course a third point is

88
0:03:09.700 --> 0:03:11.160
to write their own models completely from scratch.

89
0:03:11.160 --> 0:03:13.610
And this might be in the browser entirely.

90
0:03:13.610 --> 0:03:15.970
Or, it could be a combination of Node.js

91
0:03:15.970 --> 0:03:19.500
and then running the resulting model in the browser.

92
0:03:19.500 --> 0:03:20.240
Next slide.

slide-6
0:03:20.240 --> 0:03:21.730
And of course

94
0:03:21.730 --> 0:03:22.540
this can be used for anything you might dream up,

95
0:03:22.540 --> 0:03:23.810
and here's just a few examples

96
0:03:23.810 --> 0:03:25.450
of things people have been creating,

97
0:03:25.450 --> 0:03:27.800
that we've seen on the internet today.

98
0:03:27.800 --> 0:03:30.180
Things like augmented reality, sound recognition,

99
0:03:30.180 --> 0:03:32.890
sentiment analysis, web page optimization,

100
0:03:32.890 --> 0:03:34.810
and much much more.

101
0:03:34.810 --> 0:03:35.990
Next slide.

slide-7
0:03:35.990 --> 0:03:37.790
Well, almost anything.

slide-8
0:03:37.790 --> 0:03:39.180
And today, we'd like to talk to you

104
0:03:39.180 --> 0:03:40.360
about some of those limitations

105
0:03:40.360 --> 0:03:41.740
and roadblocks that we found

106
0:03:41.740 --> 0:03:44.540
whilst building and maintaining TensorFlow.js.

107
0:03:44.540 --> 0:03:45.730
And we believe these,

108
0:03:45.730 --> 0:03:46.830
will be applicable to any

109
0:03:46.830 --> 0:03:48.920
Machine Learning library created going forward.

110
0:03:48.920 --> 0:03:52.310
So the first point we want to talk about is Float32.

111
0:03:52.310 --> 0:03:54.260
Now, this is great for many of the tasks,

112
0:03:54.260 --> 0:03:57.230
and I know Float64 is even supported in JavaScript.

slide-9
0:03:57.230 --> 0:03:59.930
However, when we're doing model quantization,

114
0:03:59.930 --> 0:04:02.480
we actually want to support Float16,

115
0:04:02.480 --> 0:04:05.940
and this currently does not exist in JavaScript or in Wasm.

116
0:04:06.918 --> 0:04:08.170
And this is really important to us,

117
0:04:08.170 --> 0:04:10.420
so that we can execute models faster,

118
0:04:10.420 --> 0:04:13.700
and use less memory when doing so too.

119
0:04:13.700 --> 0:04:13.903
And of course,

120
0:04:13.903 --> 0:04:15.980
you might get a 10% drop-off in your model accuracy

121
0:04:15.980 --> 0:04:18.120
by doing this, but for some environments

122
0:04:18.120 --> 0:04:19.560
that might be acceptable,

123
0:04:19.560 --> 0:04:22.200
especially on mobile on older devices,

124
0:04:22.200 --> 0:04:24.960
where you might not have the speed to begin with.

125
0:04:24.960 --> 0:04:26.770
Right now, on the server-side,

126
0:04:26.770 --> 0:04:30.000
we can actually, store things in 16-bit.

127
0:04:30.000 --> 0:04:33.220
However, when we load it into JavaScript memory,

128
0:04:33.220 --> 0:04:35.380
it then gets converted to Float32,

129
0:04:35.380 --> 0:04:37.000
and we end up using the same memory

130
0:04:37.000 --> 0:04:39.730
and have the same speed as before,

131
0:04:39.730 --> 0:04:42.210
which means no progress there for us.

132
0:04:42.210 --> 0:04:43.550
Next slide.

slide-10
0:04:43.550 --> 0:04:46.430
So, what if we could support model quantization to use

134
0:04:46.430 --> 0:04:48.860
less memory and gain faster influence speeds

135
0:04:48.860 --> 0:04:50.350
in JavaScript at runtime.

136
0:04:50.350 --> 0:04:53.170
This is the question we'd like to pose to you today.

137
0:04:53.170 --> 0:04:54.770
Now, of course, to address this,

138
0:04:54.770 --> 0:04:56.760
we'd need to do this in both JavaScript

139
0:04:56.760 --> 0:04:57.780
and web assembly,

140
0:04:57.780 --> 0:05:00.832
so that supports all the environments we will execute

141
0:05:00.832 --> 0:05:02.590
in the foreseeable future,

142
0:05:02.590 --> 0:05:05.490
as we showed at the beginning of this presentation.

slide-11
0:05:05.490 --> 0:05:07.840
Next up, garbage collection.

144
0:05:07.840 --> 0:05:09.800
For WebGL.

145
0:05:09.800 --> 0:05:09.913
As you know,

146
0:05:09.913 --> 0:05:12.460
JavaScript is really great at cleaning up

147
0:05:12.460 --> 0:05:15.460
after itself when writing Vanilla JavaScript code.

148
0:05:15.460 --> 0:05:18.580
However, the same is not so true for WebGL.

149
0:05:18.580 --> 0:05:21.310
And, as you know, TensorFlow.js uses WebGL

150
0:05:21.310 --> 0:05:22.980
to get graphics card acceleration

151
0:05:22.980 --> 0:05:24.490
for our Machine Learning models

152
0:05:24.490 --> 0:05:26.283
in the web browser and beyond.

153
0:05:27.330 --> 0:05:31.280
So, right now we have a function called TF.tidy()

154
0:05:31.280 --> 0:05:33.650
that we've created to clean up after ourselves

155
0:05:33.650 --> 0:05:37.130
if the user puts their code within this function.

156
0:05:37.130 --> 0:05:39.470
However, not all users know about this

157
0:05:39.470 --> 0:05:41.670
at the very beginning especially beginners,

158
0:05:41.670 --> 0:05:43.190
and for that reason,

159
0:05:43.190 --> 0:05:45.640
it'd be really nice to have the same level of clean-up

160
0:05:45.640 --> 0:05:46.730
with graphics card memory

161
0:05:46.730 --> 0:05:49.450
as we do with the regular JavaScript code.

162
0:05:49.450 --> 0:05:50.928
Next slide.

slide-12
0:05:50.928 --> 0:05:52.210
So the question is here,

164
0:05:52.210 --> 0:05:55.180
how can we clean up WebGL memory as well?

165
0:05:55.180 --> 0:05:58.530
So we know that WebGPU is also coming down the line,

166
0:05:58.530 --> 0:05:59.880
but maybe this needs to be addressed

167
0:05:59.880 --> 0:06:01.590
in that specification as well.

168
0:06:01.590 --> 0:06:04.150
Can we clean up graphics card memory both in WebGPU

169
0:06:04.150 --> 0:06:05.859
and WebGL.

170
0:06:05.859 --> 0:06:08.300
And the latter, this also might benefit people

171
0:06:08.300 --> 0:06:10.190
working with 3D graphics and other things too

172
0:06:10.190 --> 0:06:12.340
beyond even the Machine Learning space.

slide-13
0:06:12.340 --> 0:06:14.960
Next up, graphics card acceleration.

174
0:06:14.960 --> 0:06:17.680
Currently, we have WebGL to execute Ops

175
0:06:17.680 --> 0:06:20.650
in the machine learning model as we previously discussed,

176
0:06:20.650 --> 0:06:22.760
but it'd be much more efficient if the browser exposed

177
0:06:22.760 --> 0:06:24.760
lower level APIs to the graphics card

178
0:06:24.760 --> 0:06:27.360
so we could more efficiently leverage the hardware.

179
0:06:27.360 --> 0:06:28.700
Next slide.

slide-14
0:06:28.700 --> 0:06:29.710
Now,

181
0:06:29.710 --> 0:06:32.270
the question here is what lower level support do we need

182
0:06:32.270 --> 0:06:35.510
for efficient Machine Learning when using the graphics card.

183
0:06:35.510 --> 0:06:37.830
And of course, WebGPU is on the way,

184
0:06:37.830 --> 0:06:40.380
but, what else needs to be added to that spec

185
0:06:40.380 --> 0:06:42.790
to ensure we have something that works well,

186
0:06:42.790 --> 0:06:45.640
specifically for machine learning.

slide-15
0:06:45.640 --> 0:06:48.570
Next up, we've got Model Security.

188
0:06:48.570 --> 0:06:50.560
Now we see a lot of production use cases,

189
0:06:50.560 --> 0:06:53.110
whereby they require the model to be securely delivered

190
0:06:53.110 --> 0:06:55.400
to the client, in a way that it can't be copied

191
0:06:55.400 --> 0:06:57.800
and used on other websites.

192
0:06:57.800 --> 0:06:59.570
Especially for large corporate brands,

193
0:06:59.570 --> 0:07:03.300
they spend a lot of money and time creating these models,

194
0:07:03.300 --> 0:07:05.900
and where they won't just give away their IP for free.

195
0:07:05.900 --> 0:07:07.500
Next slide.

slide-16
0:07:07.500 --> 0:07:08.990
So, our question is here,

197
0:07:08.990 --> 0:07:12.260
how can we deliver a Machine Learning model

198
0:07:12.260 --> 0:07:15.800
to the JavaScript environment in the Web browser,

199
0:07:15.800 --> 0:07:16.390
without revealing it,

200
0:07:16.390 --> 0:07:18.810
maybe there's a way that we can have a secure way

201
0:07:18.810 --> 0:07:21.870
to grab some arbitrary JavaScript code from the server,

202
0:07:21.870 --> 0:07:23.210
that is doing Machine Learning stuff

203
0:07:23.210 --> 0:07:24.430
along with the model as well

204
0:07:24.430 --> 0:07:26.600
and the assets you might need to execute,

205
0:07:26.600 --> 0:07:28.920
and all that can be downloaded by the browser

206
0:07:28.920 --> 0:07:30.200
behind the scenes,

207
0:07:30.200 --> 0:07:32.000
in private memory,

208
0:07:32.000 --> 0:07:34.300
which cannot be accessed by the JS developer

209
0:07:34.300 --> 0:07:35.460
on the front end.

210
0:07:35.460 --> 0:07:36.293
However,

211
0:07:36.293 --> 0:07:39.380
they can do some kind of remote procedure call to that code,

212
0:07:39.380 --> 0:07:42.830
so that they can execute it and get results back,

213
0:07:42.830 --> 0:07:45.323
without exposing the model itself.

214
0:07:46.160 --> 0:07:47.550
And this is up to discussion of course,

215
0:07:47.550 --> 0:07:50.470
that's just one example of how it could be solved

216
0:07:50.470 --> 0:07:53.490
which would require browser level implementation support

217
0:07:53.490 --> 0:07:54.563
to do that properly.

218
0:07:55.420 --> 0:07:57.180
And currently, this is a big barrier

219
0:07:57.180 --> 0:07:59.800
for many people trying to go into production-use cases

220
0:07:59.800 --> 0:08:02.670
but still want the benefits of running on the client side,

221
0:08:02.670 --> 0:08:05.430
such as privacy and lower latency

222
0:08:05.430 --> 0:08:07.700
and cost savings on the server.

223
0:08:07.700 --> 0:08:08.533
And of course,

224
0:08:08.533 --> 0:08:10.760
as soon as you put the model on the server-side,

225
0:08:10.760 --> 0:08:12.100
those benefits disappear

226
0:08:12.100 --> 0:08:13.810
because you have to then send the data from the client

227
0:08:13.810 --> 0:08:14.643
to the server.

228
0:08:15.590 --> 0:08:16.710
Next slide.

slide-17
0:08:16.710 --> 0:08:18.930
And what about model warm-up,

230
0:08:18.930 --> 0:08:20.300
it can take a couple of uses

231
0:08:20.300 --> 0:08:23.170
before the model can actually run at the optimal speed

232
0:08:23.170 --> 0:08:25.300
in the browser environment.

233
0:08:25.300 --> 0:08:27.200
Of course, first of all you need to download the model.

234
0:08:27.200 --> 0:08:28.650
Secondly you need to load it into memory

235
0:08:28.650 --> 0:08:30.700
and pass all that stuff, and then thirdly,

236
0:08:30.700 --> 0:08:32.700
you need to just run some data for at once

237
0:08:32.700 --> 0:08:34.710
to get everything else set up.

238
0:08:34.710 --> 0:08:36.790
And this can take a non trivial amount of time

239
0:08:36.790 --> 0:08:38.320
especially for larger models.

240
0:08:38.320 --> 0:08:39.790
Next slide.

slide-18
0:08:39.790 --> 0:08:42.260
So the question here becomes,

242
0:08:42.260 --> 0:08:44.130
what if there is a standardized way

243
0:08:44.130 --> 0:08:46.620
to specify that a better model is available

244
0:08:46.620 --> 0:08:48.850
and should be prepared and swapped to when ready

245
0:08:48.850 --> 0:08:51.500
kinda like progressive enhancement.

246
0:08:51.500 --> 0:08:53.130
Now taking a very hypothetical example,

247
0:08:53.130 --> 0:08:55.990
maybe you've got an object recognition model,

248
0:08:55.990 --> 0:08:57.550
and this could be something like COCO SSD

249
0:08:57.550 --> 0:08:59.220
that gives you the bounding box data.

250
0:08:59.220 --> 0:09:01.480
This loads really fast in the web browser right now

251
0:09:01.480 --> 0:09:03.960
and can be used very quickly and efficiently.

252
0:09:03.960 --> 0:09:06.400
But maybe your end goal is to actually have some

253
0:09:06.400 --> 0:09:07.990
kind of image segmentation model

254
0:09:07.990 --> 0:09:10.210
which might be heavier to load.

255
0:09:10.210 --> 0:09:13.250
So what if you could take that initial smaller model,

256
0:09:13.250 --> 0:09:16.700
load that, get some results coming in straight away,

257
0:09:16.700 --> 0:09:17.540
but once

258
0:09:17.540 --> 0:09:19.220
heavier model is actually ready,

259
0:09:19.220 --> 0:09:21.110
you can switch to that automatically.

260
0:09:21.110 --> 0:09:22.540
And this could be very interesting

261
0:09:22.540 --> 0:09:25.130
as things progress and we start seeing larger models

262
0:09:25.130 --> 0:09:29.800
being used in the web environment in many years to come.

0:09:29.800 --> 0:09:29.913

which might inspire you as well

270
0:09:41.860 --> 0:09:44.210
of other questions for this discussion.

271
0:09:44.210 --> 0:09:46.710
People are really pushing the boundaries by combining

272
0:09:46.710 --> 0:09:48.250
TensorFlow.js

273
0:09:48.250 --> 0:09:51.850
with things like WebGL, WebRTC,

274
0:09:51.850 --> 0:09:52.683
WebXR,

275
0:09:52.683 --> 0:09:54.490
all these other web standards are combining

276
0:09:54.490 --> 0:09:57.610
with Machine Learning to do many many great things.

277
0:09:57.610 --> 0:09:59.250
So, feel free to check that out,

278
0:09:59.250 --> 0:10:01.610
and we'd love to talk to you later on

279
