00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:11.206
<v ->Hello, this is Mingqiu Sun.</v>

2
00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:14.016
I have my colleague, Andrew Brown with me.

3
00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:16.249
Today, we're gonna talk about WASI-NN,

4
00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:21.649
stand for WebAssembly System Interface for Neural Network.

slide-2
00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:23.909
Next slide.

6
00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:27.408
Let's talk about what is WASI?

7
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:29.776
WASI stand for WebAssembly System Interface.

8
00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:34.716
It's a subgroup of the WebAssembly CG,

9
00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:39.226
and we are the official group to define WASI API.

10
00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.469
And here the GitHub repo,

11
00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:48.019
and we have a video meeting biweekly.

12
00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:53.086
WASI is using Witx

13
00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.729
to defined interface.

14
00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:57.576
Next slide.

slide-3
00:00:57.576 --> 00:01:00.736
So let me talk about some background information

16
00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:02.806
about Bytecode Alliance.

17
00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:06.836
So this is an open source community that we're dedicated to,

18
00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:11.236
you know, create a secure new software foundation,

19
00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:16.236
building on top of such standard as web assembly, and WASI.

20
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.223
Mozilla, Fastly, Intel and RedHat

21
00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:21.909
are the founding members.

22
00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:25.826
Currently, we have three major engagement

23
00:01:25.826 --> 00:01:29.026
with that organization.

24
00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:34.026
We contribute a small footprint web assembly

25
00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:38.296
implementation coder or WebAssembly Micro Runtime.

26
00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:42.339
We are responsible for SIMD implementation in Wasmtime,

27
00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:46.966
and we are driving this WASI Neural Network interface

28
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:49.596
definition and the POC.

29
00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:53.366
So those are the three major activity we are engaged with.

30
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:56.306
And today, we're gonna talk about the WASI-NN.

31
00:01:58.106 --> 00:01:58.989
Slide four.

slide-4
00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:04.546
So let's talk about why we are talking about this.

33
00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:07.379
What's the motivation behind WASI neural network?

34
00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:13.676
So, in a typical use scenario for machine learning,

35
00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:15.756
trained model need to be deployed

36
00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:19.706
on a wide variety of devices

37
00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:23.376
with different architecture and operating systems.

38
00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:28.036
So, web assembly is a perfect, you know,

39
00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:30.706
format for this kind of deployment

40
00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:33.043
because it's platform independent.

41
00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:35.606
So why WASI?

42
00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:38.166
Why not doing machine learning, you know,

43
00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.456
completely inside web assembly?

44
00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:43.066
So the main reason is that machine learning typically

45
00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:46.436
require a special hardware support

46
00:02:46.436 --> 00:02:48.796
in order to be high performance.

47
00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:50.836
You know, for example, for CPU,

48
00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:55.836
typically, the AVX512 to have extremely good, you know,

49
00:02:57.316 --> 00:02:59.906
performance and similarly, you know,

50
00:02:59.906 --> 00:03:04.479
you might need a GPU, TPU for hardware acceleration.

51
00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:08.616
So machine learning is still evolving rapidly

52
00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:11.676
and there was like a new operation and a new

53
00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:14.936
network topology emerging continuously.

54
00:03:14.936 --> 00:03:17.416
So it makes sense to have a system interface

55
00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:21.756
that connect with a special implementation

56
00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:25.975
of those topology or new operations

57
00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:28.909
outside a web assembly domain.

58
00:03:30.506 --> 00:03:31.996
Slide five.

slide-5
00:03:31.996 --> 00:03:34.389
So here a few design considerations.

60
00:03:35.536 --> 00:03:37.256
We are focusing on more,

61
00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:40.049
what's called a model loader API first,

62
00:03:40.896 --> 00:03:41.729
because you know,

63
00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:45.366
inferencing is by, you know, quantity,

64
00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:48.586
it's a vast majority of our machine learning use cases.

65
00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:52.156
And that's the reason that it's our initial focus

66
00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:56.679
and we plan, you know, to add training part later on.

67
00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:01.376
Secondly, you know, it's a simpler API

68
00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:04.276
with excellent IP protection.

69
00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:07.216
So you don't need to expose the internal details

70
00:04:07.216 --> 00:04:09.376
about your machine learning model

71
00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:10.579
through this API.

72
00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:15.436
And it was inspired by the WebNN effort

73
00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:20.546
and they have very similar model loader API.

74
00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:22.746
And then, we had the joint review with them.

75
00:04:24.114 --> 00:04:28.546
So, our intention is to make this API framework

76
00:04:28.546 --> 00:04:31.326
and the model format agnostic,

77
00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:34.806
and then we expect that it will be supported

78
00:04:34.806 --> 00:04:37.186
on a wide variety of devices,

79
00:04:37.186 --> 00:04:41.009
such as CPU, GPU, FPGA, and TPU.

80
00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:43.706
So next slide.

81
00:04:43.706 --> 00:04:47.416
We're gonna turn over to my colleague, Andrew,

82
00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:50.389
to cover the actual API definition.

slide-6
00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:55.266
<v ->Hi, so the proposed WASI-NN interface</v>

84
00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:57.379
is available at this link.

85
00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:01.686
If you see some of the examples from this slide,

86
00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:06.626
you'll see that it specifies a way to describe tensors,

87
00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:08.936
a way to load models,

88
00:05:08.936 --> 00:05:12.276
and a way to execute inference requests

89
00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:16.186
using those tensors and the loaded models.

90
00:05:16.186 --> 00:05:19.256
The proposal does not yet include a mechanism

91
00:05:19.256 --> 00:05:20.469
for training models.

92
00:05:21.616 --> 00:05:24.706
And also notable is it doesn't specify

93
00:05:24.706 --> 00:05:26.516
the encoding of the model.

94
00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:29.626
And so, that model format is opaque

95
00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:32.906
at the WASI-NN interface level.

96
00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:37.086
That means that the implementation of WASI-NN,

97
00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:40.116
what's in the, for example, WebAssembly runtime

98
00:05:40.116 --> 00:05:42.356
would have to understand the model format

99
00:05:42.356 --> 00:05:45.679
in order to perform the inference.

100
00:05:46.786 --> 00:05:47.909
Next slide.

slide-7
00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:54.230
What you're looking at here is a sort of

102
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.576
simple architecture diagram of a POC

103
00:05:57.576 --> 00:06:01.419
that we're attempting, that we're looking at in Wasmtime.

104
00:06:02.656 --> 00:06:05.656
Once complete, what you'll be able to do

105
00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:09.816
is take user application code and a WASI-NN header,

106
00:06:09.816 --> 00:06:12.319
and compile that to a WASM file.

107
00:06:13.576 --> 00:06:18.316
If you combine that with a trained model,

108
00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:22.593
potentially converted using OpenVINO's model optimizer,

109
00:06:24.126 --> 00:06:27.136
you can hand those over to Wasmtime

110
00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:31.269
and Wasmtime will be able to execute the WASM file

111
00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:36.616
using the model file to perform inference.

112
00:06:36.616 --> 00:06:39.456
And the path we're taking right now is

113
00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:43.516
to implement the WASI-NN interface using OpenVINO,

114
00:06:43.516 --> 00:06:45.396
which would allow us to perform inference

115
00:06:45.396 --> 00:06:48.239
on a variety of different hardware.

116
00:06:49.296 --> 00:06:51.076
Back to you, Mingqiu.

slide-8
00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:51.909
<v ->Okay.</v>

118
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:53.306
So call for action.

119
00:06:53.306 --> 00:06:57.606
So this is still like an early stage of proposal.

120
00:06:57.606 --> 00:07:02.606
We would like to welcome your input on this proposal

121
00:07:02.896 --> 00:07:05.209
to engage us in the WASI community.

122
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.109
This is, you know, early stage, as I said,

123
00:07:10.108 --> 00:07:13.586
and it's easy to change if you see anything you don't like.

124
00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:14.699
Thank you very much.
