slide-1
00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:11.386
<v Josh>Hi, welcome to our cognitive accessibility</v>

2
00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.186
and machine learning presentation

3
00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:16.246
for the W3C machine-learning workshop.

4
00:00:16.246 --> 00:00:18.086
I'm very, very happy to be here.

5
00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:19.886
My name's is Josh O'Connor.

6
00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:21.896
I'm emerging technology specialist

7
00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.256
with W3C Web Accessibility Initiative.

8
00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:28.026
I'm here with my colleague, Lisa Seeman also,

9
00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:31.676
who is the task force facilitator from the COGA,

10
00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:34.036
the Cognitive Accessibility Task Force.

11
00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:36.066
And we are going to be talking about

12
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.876
cognitive accessibility and machine learning -

13
00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:43.126
beyond rule-based testing environments.

14
00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.906
So great, Lisa, over to you.

15
00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.116
Let's hear a little bit

16
00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:48.599
about what we're gonna be discussing.

slide-2
00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:51.666
<v Lisa>And these are really research topics</v>

18
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:55.806
or early prototype stages for these kinds of things.

19
00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:59.686
The first is that machine learning can offer

20
00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:02.326
potential solutions for people with cognitive disability,

21
00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:04.246
to bridge the gap in understanding

22
00:01:04.246 --> 00:01:07.616
on what people can can comprehend

23
00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:09.836
and putting things in a format

24
00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.706
that they can understand better,

25
00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:15.296
like simplified languages, as one example,

26
00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:19.286
usability testing for people with cognitive disabilities

27
00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:21.426
to be as software as a service

28
00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:24.636
or some other compatible mechanism

29
00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:27.956
that would enable automatic testing.

30
00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:30.996
And also, there's some movement

31
00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:32.076
in the other direction.

32
00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:35.056
Because I think there's the potential

33
00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:36.646
for what we're doing

34
00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:39.146
for support for cognitive disabilities,

35
00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:44.146
to actually help machine learning type algorithms

36
00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:50.816
perform better, and have maybe an anchor or more information

37
00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:52.056
on what's going on in the page

38
00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:55.556
so that if it's adapting it for other applications,

39
00:01:55.556 --> 00:01:58.516
it will perform a bit better.

40
00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:00.726
<v Josh>So we're going to be talking about</v>

41
00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:02.489
how machine learning can support people

42
00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.666
with cognitive disabilities,

43
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.586
how this could potentially enable

44
00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:08.616
the better testing of that support.

45
00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:09.746
Just generally understand

46
00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:13.446
how inclusive design can support even machine learning

47
00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:15.376
by developing data sets,

48
00:02:15.376 --> 00:02:17.736
which understand what works or what does not work

49
00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:20.536
for particular diverse user groups. Is that right?

50
00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:23.736
<v Lisa>Yeah. Some kind of going in the other direction.</v>

51
00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:27.236
There's tons of things where machine learning can help us

52
00:02:27.236 --> 00:02:29.966
as people trying to provide support

53
00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:32.196
for people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities,

54
00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:33.506
and create new tools.

55
00:02:33.506 --> 00:02:38.506
But actually, we could be helping other examples

56
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:43.396
of machine learning application by what we're doing.

57
00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:44.229
<v Josh>Absolutely.</v>

slide-3
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.356
So going on to the next sections on slide two

59
00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:49.906
user testing and cognitive and machine learning.

60
00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:52.846
<v Lisa>Yeah, so right now,</v>

61
00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:55.336
a lot of the conformance

62
00:02:55.336 --> 00:02:59.396
for accessibility regulations and guidelines

63
00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:02.706
are kind of pattern matching rules.

64
00:03:02.706 --> 00:03:05.046
So does this image have an alt tag?

65
00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:07.686
If not, it might not conform to something.

66
00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:10.346
You know part level of pattern match.

67
00:03:10.346 --> 00:03:13.366
And that really didn't work well for us,

68
00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:15.646
trying to incorporate the user needs

69
00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:18.376
for people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities .

slide-4
00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:22.086
For instance, move to slide two,

71
00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:24.956
an example of a user need or pattern

72
00:03:24.956 --> 00:03:28.176
that we would be introducing

73
00:03:28.176 --> 00:03:30.456
Cognitive and Learning Disabilities is:

74
00:03:30.456 --> 00:03:32.846
can we identify the controls on the page?

75
00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:34.476
Does a button look like a button?

76
00:03:34.476 --> 00:03:36.586
Or do they think it's a heading?

77
00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:39.556
Or just text? Is it recognizable?

78
00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:42.776
Well, this is something that's very hard to do

79
00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:44.656
with straightforward rules.

80
00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:47.156
You know, if this is missing,

81
00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:50.046
if there's a button that doesn't have this,

82
00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:54.306
then it's a fail. Those kind of unit test rules.

83
00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:55.139
It's very hard.

84
00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:55.972
It's a bit...

85
00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:57.626
it's subjective, and it moves.

86
00:03:57.626 --> 00:04:01.116
What's familiar depends on which group.

87
00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:04.566
So we would recommend user testing

88
00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:07.056
with a bunch of different groups,

89
00:04:07.056 --> 00:04:10.036
and recording what people find usable.

slide-5
00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:14.056
So if you're using a link, and it's blue and underlined,

91
00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:16.196
let's assume that it's recognizable.

92
00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:18.556
But if you've got other ways of doing a link,

93
00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:21.856
well, it might be very different for an 18-year-old

94
00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:25.576
with down syndrome to a 70-year-old

95
00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:29.086
with age appropriate forgetfulness,

96
00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:33.186
who's having trouble learning new design patterns.

slide-6
00:04:33.186 --> 00:04:35.976
Putting that into a standard

98
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.656
has been really, really challenging.

99
00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:42.456
People will often know if it's recognizable or not,

100
00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:46.046
but how do you make that something that you could test?

101
00:04:46.046 --> 00:04:48.736
<v Josh>So there are issues, Lisa, with mapping affordances</v>

102
00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:50.696
in a way that's consistent,

103
00:04:50.696 --> 00:04:52.346
depending on a user's preference,

104
00:04:52.346 --> 00:04:53.516
or the user's requirements,

105
00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:56.406
particularly if they've got diverse ability.

106
00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:58.186
<v Lisa>Yes, that's one thing...</v>

107
00:04:58.186 --> 00:05:03.186
that's one way we're trying to look at it.

108
00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:08.346
So the advantages of machine learning here

109
00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:12.436
is that the algorithm could be trained

110
00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:16.936
on what people have found usable

111
00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:19.566
and recognize straight away,

112
00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:22.256
and learn what for this user base

113
00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:24.086
is considered recognizable

114
00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:25.676
and what's not recognizable.

115
00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:28.496
And we could introduce a certainty components

116
00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:31.516
such as if we say something should be likely

117
00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:36.516
it's over 90% certainties, assume that it's accessible.

slide-7
00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:39.616
And that could kind of bridge the gap.

119
00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:42.286
As we've got on slide five,

120
00:05:42.286 --> 00:05:44.346
between the need of saying,

121
00:05:44.346 --> 00:05:45.606
perform user testing,

122
00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:47.176
that's how you're gonna know

123
00:05:47.176 --> 00:05:50.176
and having some kind of automated solution

124
00:05:50.176 --> 00:05:53.656
that's less scary and  easier.

125
00:05:53.656 --> 00:05:56.946
<v Josh>So, the machine learning patterns will have a way</v>

126
00:05:56.946 --> 00:05:59.616
of giving us a certain statistical confidence

127
00:05:59.616 --> 00:06:01.946
that something is likely to work or not

128
00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:05.316
based on large pattern matching

129
00:06:05.316 --> 00:06:08.016
of various different kinds of interactions.

slide-8
00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:11.926
So how can inclusive design support machine learning?

slide-9
00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:14.366
If we move on then to slide six?

132
00:06:14.366 --> 00:06:17.926
<v Lisa>Well, we have some new technologies that we've made.</v>

133
00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:19.396
We've got at wide review

134
00:06:19.396 --> 00:06:22.906
going to CR of Personalization Semantics,

135
00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:27.186
where we will put on a mapping to a concept notes

136
00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:31.816
so that symbols can be added for different use cases

137
00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:33.316
or symbols can be adapted

138
00:06:33.316 --> 00:06:35.766
if people have learned a specific symbol set,

139
00:06:35.766 --> 00:06:38.516
and that's what is familiar to them,

140
00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:40.836
as well as other support can be integrated

141
00:06:40.836 --> 00:06:45.476
into the page such as instructions or help scaffolding.

142
00:06:45.476 --> 00:06:50.106
So this kind of information actually tells machine learning,

143
00:06:50.106 --> 00:06:55.036
the right answer of what this button is, what does this do?

144
00:06:55.036 --> 00:06:58.236
What concept did I mean when I said this?

145
00:06:58.236 --> 00:07:02.341
So that would then have almost a 100% certainty

146
00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:04.666
or close to it.

147
00:07:04.666 --> 00:07:08.766
You can then use that for giving context,

148
00:07:08.766 --> 00:07:11.346
and that could upgrade the performance

149
00:07:11.346 --> 00:07:15.916
of things like automatic translation,

150
00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:20.916
and other transformations or analysis of web content.

151
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:22.816
<v Josh>Great. That sounds great.</v>

slide-10
00:07:22.816 --> 00:07:24.596
So we're talking about,

153
00:07:24.596 --> 00:07:26.836
on slide seven semantic tokens,

154
00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:28.926
allowing the association of these

155
00:07:28.926 --> 00:07:33.116
various different preferred symbols with current elements.

156
00:07:33.116 --> 00:07:35.056
How do you see machine learning even supporting

157
00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:36.486
the creation of these symbols?

158
00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:40.686
Do you think it's because if you have things described

159
00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:42.206
in a way that's semantically accurate,

160
00:07:42.206 --> 00:07:44.356
that allows levels of abstraction

161
00:07:44.356 --> 00:07:45.826
that machine learning could support

162
00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:47.684
in a large kind of aggregated manner?

163
00:07:47.684 --> 00:07:48.517
Is that something that you think…?

164
00:07:48.517 --> 00:07:51.306
<v Lisa>Yeah, it can go back and forth Josh.</v>

165
00:07:51.306 --> 00:07:54.396
Because if you've got, say, an authoring tool

166
00:07:54.396 --> 00:07:59.279
that adds the concept notes, if you like, into the code.

167
00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:04.716
And if it does it 80% accurate,

168
00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:07.366
which currently is about the rate.

169
00:08:07.366 --> 00:08:10.946
It makes mistakes, but the author will understand the symbol

170
00:08:10.946 --> 00:08:12.726
and will understand what they intended.

171
00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:16.806
So if you said bank and you meant the financial institution,

172
00:08:16.806 --> 00:08:20.426
it puts a bank of river, you'll know this is wrong

173
00:08:20.426 --> 00:08:22.836
and you can switch it,

174
00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:26.606
if you're using that as an anchor for machine translation

175
00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:28.026
to other languages maybe,

176
00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:32.315
and I leave this to the audience who knows more,

177
00:08:32.315 --> 00:08:35.266
but maybe that could provide the context

178
00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:39.266
to provide better machine translation,

179
00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:43.286
you know, a bit of context can trigger more certainty

180
00:08:43.286 --> 00:08:47.756
down the line, and we're all fighting the same ambiguities

181
00:08:48.706 --> 00:08:50.776
when we make mistakes.

182
00:08:50.776 --> 00:08:54.096
So if we're solving it to be able to translate

183
00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:57.746
across different symbol languages, in one language,

184
00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.986
then it could also potentially help

185
00:09:00.986 --> 00:09:04.176
to map across different languages.

slide-11
00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:09.176
<v Josh>Great stuff. So in terms of new solutions for inclusion</v>

187
00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:12.556
why do you feel that machine learning can be more similar

188
00:09:12.556 --> 00:09:14.496
to how humans actually think

189
00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:16.456
that's a very interesting insight?

slide-12
00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:18.046
<v Lisa>Yeah, well, machine learning</v>

191
00:09:18.046 --> 00:09:20.166
and new on that, for instance,

192
00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:23.186
is more similar to how most people think,

193
00:09:23.186 --> 00:09:25.546
most of us don't think like,

194
00:09:25.546 --> 00:09:28.801
not often so much in a sequential way

195
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:32.176
of these rule-based algorithms.

196
00:09:32.176 --> 00:09:37.176
So in a way machine learning is based on how people think.

197
00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:41.306
And so therefore, it could fill the gaps

198
00:09:41.306 --> 00:09:44.816
on where there's some kind of problem.

199
00:09:44.816 --> 00:09:48.516
So, for instance, people with dyscalculia,

200
00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:49.976
the area of the brain,

201
00:09:49.976 --> 00:09:54.726
which processes numerical concepts, is impaired.

202
00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:59.082
So they struggle very much with money

203
00:09:59.082 --> 00:10:02.186
and trying to figure out what's more, what's less,

204
00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:04.196
let alone what's expensive.

205
00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:06.346
So being able to make a judgment call

206
00:10:06.346 --> 00:10:08.936
on whether this item is expensive or not,

207
00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:11.996
that would be quite a long sequential algorithm

208
00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:13.546
with traditional computing.

209
00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:17.846
Something like machine learning might be...

210
00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:21.436
I mean, I know some bots that are working on that,

211
00:10:21.436 --> 00:10:25.976
so that kind of decision making, it could be supportive.

212
00:10:25.976 --> 00:10:27.673
Another example is vision loss.

213
00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:30.806
You have an image,

214
00:10:30.806 --> 00:10:34.276
they haven't all had got alternative text.

215
00:10:34.276 --> 00:10:36.446
What would be a good description of the image?

216
00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:38.946
And what's the image trying to convey

217
00:10:38.946 --> 00:10:41.256
with its red and yellow signage?

218
00:10:41.256 --> 00:10:46.256
That might be a warning, which is more than OCR could do.

219
00:10:46.426 --> 00:10:50.496
So that's more like that the instant recognition

220
00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:54.986
of the mood of this image that's portraying something.

221
00:10:54.986 --> 00:10:57.486
<v Josh>Right. So that's sophisticated image recognition,</v>

222
00:10:57.486 --> 00:11:00.766
which can support different disability types.

slide-13
00:11:00.766 --> 00:11:05.156
I know one of the things that you are quite concerned about

224
00:11:05.156 --> 00:11:08.766
is the inclusion of people with cognitive disabilities

225
00:11:08.766 --> 00:11:11.656
and their related data within the data sets,

226
00:11:11.656 --> 00:11:13.716
they're used to power machine learning

227
00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:16.356
or any kind of algorithmic based application,

228
00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:19.596
such as smart cities or whatnot.

229
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.625
So could you speak a little bit

230
00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:24.296
about just the importance of having diverse data sets?

slide-14
00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:28.676
<v Lisa>Yeah. And this is one of the big fears, I think.</v>

232
00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:33.656
And it happens already that people with disabilities,

233
00:11:33.656 --> 00:11:36.376
or other groups, it might be people

234
00:11:36.376 --> 00:11:39.856
who can't afford a smartphone. They're not using the apps

235
00:11:39.856 --> 00:11:42.656
and they're not using the websites

236
00:11:42.656 --> 00:11:46.456
and some of the tools that the phone calls

237
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:50.866
that you can't manage because of the phone menu systems

238
00:11:50.866 --> 00:11:54.446
can be very difficult for people to manage.

239
00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:57.286
And so then they don't call

240
00:11:57.286 --> 00:12:00.146
because they know they can't reach a human

241
00:12:00.146 --> 00:12:04.116
and then missed out of the data gathering process

242
00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:06.496
and not in those data sets.

243
00:12:06.496 --> 00:12:09.326
And therefore they're kind of invisible

244
00:12:11.046 --> 00:12:13.076
in the whole decision making process

245
00:12:13.076 --> 00:12:14.876
that's based on these data sets,

246
00:12:14.876 --> 00:12:16.306
whether it's machine learning,

247
00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:18.706
or other algorithms.

248
00:12:18.706 --> 00:12:23.106
And that then will result in solutions

249
00:12:23.106 --> 00:12:26.376
that don't consider them.

250
00:12:26.376 --> 00:12:29.316
But as this becomes more pervasive with smart cities,

251
00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:32.156
with managing all these critical services,

252
00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:34.886
and people again think, “Oh yes, our services are good.”

253
00:12:34.886 --> 00:12:36.366
Et cetera.

254
00:12:36.366 --> 00:12:40.576
And it's just because the people who can't manage

255
00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:44.516
this service, who aren't getting the critical help they need

256
00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:46.251
are missing from the data sets.

257
00:12:46.251 --> 00:12:49.306
And that's going to be a very big fear.

258
00:12:49.306 --> 00:12:53.246
<v Josh>Well, I think that's a very prescient and a sobering</v>

259
00:12:53.246 --> 00:12:54.166
kind of assessment

260
00:12:54.166 --> 00:12:57.586
and shows that when we have generic data sets

261
00:12:57.586 --> 00:13:00.718
that are being used to drive algorithmic type decisions,

262
00:13:00.718 --> 00:13:03.716
it can have a very negative impact on people

263
00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.976
in ways that we can't initially perceive.

264
00:13:05.976 --> 00:13:07.726
So Lisa, just finally, thanks very much.

265
00:13:07.726 --> 00:13:08.966
This is really, really great.

slide-15
00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:10.456
We do focus in APA,

267
00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.556
the Accessible Platforms Architecture group,

268
00:13:12.556 --> 00:13:14.096
and the Research Questions Task Force

269
00:13:14.096 --> 00:13:16.286
on where there are various nexuses

270
00:13:16.286 --> 00:13:18.546
between different technologies,

271
00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:20.756
different platforms and accessibility.

272
00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:22.756
You know, we do invite everyone

273
00:13:22.756 --> 00:13:25.186
who's at this workshop to contribute to this work

274
00:13:25.186 --> 00:13:29.236
and we welcome feedback on the presentation

275
00:13:29.236 --> 00:13:31.466
that we've given and the research that Lisa's is doing

276
00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:33.032
in the Cognitive Accessibility Task Force.

277
00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:36.766
And we hope that this discussion is useful and beneficial,

278
00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:40.449
and everyone has enjoyed it, and found it useful.

slide-16
00:13:41.366 --> 00:13:43.506
Lisa, thank you very much.

280
00:13:43.506 --> 00:13:44.659
<v Lisa>Thank you, Josh.</v>
