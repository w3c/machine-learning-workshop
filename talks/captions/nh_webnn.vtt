0:00:09.300 --> 0:00:11.460
<v ->Hello everyone, welcome.</v>

2
0:00:11.460 --> 0:00:15.590
I'm Ningxin Hu, a principal engineer at Intel.

3
0:00:15.590 --> 0:00:18.400
I'm participating in the W3C machine learning

4
0:00:18.400 --> 0:00:20.700
for the web community group.

5
0:00:20.700 --> 0:00:24.720
Today, my topic is about the new web standard proposal,

6
0:00:24.720 --> 0:00:27.400
the Web Neural Network API

7
0:00:27.400 --> 0:00:30.900
and how it can help web apps and frameworks

8
0:00:30.900 --> 0:00:34.300
to access purpose-built machine learning hardware.

9
0:00:34.300 --> 0:00:38.360
I'd like to thank everyone who contributes to this proposal.

10
0:00:38.360 --> 0:00:39.970
Slide two.

slide-2
0:00:39.970 --> 0:00:42.170
As you know, in the last decade,

12
0:00:42.170 --> 0:00:44.120
the machine learning, in particular,

13
0:00:44.120 --> 0:00:47.560
the deep learning has been getting increasingly important

14
0:00:47.560 --> 0:00:50.650
and widely applied in many applications,

15
0:00:50.650 --> 0:00:55.290
computer vision, speech recognition, noise cancellation.

16
0:00:55.290 --> 0:00:57.500
Nowadays, thanks to the emerging

17
0:00:57.500 --> 0:01:00.300
JavaScript machine learning frameworks,

18
0:01:00.300 --> 0:01:00.900
the web apps

19
0:01:00.900 --> 0:01:04.860
now can easily incorporate this innovative usage

20
0:01:04.860 --> 0:01:08.450
by running the machine learning models in the web browser.

21
0:01:08.450 --> 0:01:12.460
Underlining those frameworks usually leverage WebAssembly,

22
0:01:12.460 --> 0:01:16.300
WebGL and WebGPU to run the machine learning computation

23
0:01:16.300 --> 0:01:18.993
on CPU and GPU, respectively.

24
0:01:19.990 --> 0:01:21.310
Slide three.

slide-3
0:01:21.310 --> 0:01:22.310
On the other hand,

26
0:01:22.310 --> 0:01:26.140
to the exponential increasement of the computing demand

27
0:01:26.140 --> 0:01:27.970
for machine learning workload,

28
0:01:27.970 --> 0:01:30.400
the innovation of hardware architecture

29
0:01:30.400 --> 0:01:32.520
is advancing very fast.

30
0:01:32.520 --> 0:01:35.140
The machine learning extensions has been added

31
0:01:35.140 --> 0:01:37.450
into the CPU and GPU.

32
0:01:37.450 --> 0:01:40.850
A bunch of new dedicated machine learning accelerators

33
0:01:40.850 --> 0:01:45.580
is emerging, such as NPU, VPU and DSP.

34
0:01:45.580 --> 0:01:47.510
These dedicated accelerators

35
0:01:47.510 --> 0:01:50.270
not only help optimize the performance

36
0:01:50.270 --> 0:01:53.520
but also help reduce the power consumption.

37
0:01:53.520 --> 0:01:56.780
By taking advantage of these hardware features,

38
0:01:56.780 --> 0:02:00.300
the native apps got very good performance.

39
0:02:00.300 --> 0:02:01.433
So, how about the web?

40
0:02:02.580 --> 0:02:03.780
Slide four.

slide-4
0:02:03.780 --> 0:02:06.520
To compare the performance of web and native,

42
0:02:06.520 --> 0:02:08.670
we use MobileNet as workload

43
0:02:08.670 --> 0:02:11.290
and measure the inference latency.

44
0:02:11.290 --> 0:02:12.700
For hardware devices,

45
0:02:12.700 --> 0:02:16.180
we use a laptop with Vector Neural Network Instructions,

46
0:02:16.180 --> 0:02:18.760
as known as VNNI in the CPU,

47
0:02:18.760 --> 0:02:20.723
and a smartphone has a DSP.

48
0:02:21.580 --> 0:02:24.750
According to the charts, there is a big performance gap

49
0:02:24.750 --> 0:02:26.880
between web and native.

50
0:02:26.880 --> 0:02:28.840
For instance, on the laptop,

51
0:02:28.840 --> 0:02:32.480
the native CPU inference is about 10 times faster

52
0:02:32.480 --> 0:02:36.270
than WebAssembly for a float32 precision.

53
0:02:36.270 --> 0:02:37.720
The reason behind that

54
0:02:37.720 --> 0:02:42.690
is a native can access 256 bit Vector Instruction,

55
0:02:42.690 --> 0:02:46.960
however, WebAssembly only has 128 bit.

56
0:02:46.960 --> 0:02:50.480
The native GPU inference is about nine times faster

57
0:02:50.480 --> 0:02:54.190
than WebGL for a float16 precision.

58
0:02:54.190 --> 0:02:57.890
That's because optimized machine learning kernels

59
0:02:57.890 --> 0:03:01.403
within the GPU driver are not available to WebGL.

60
0:03:02.580 --> 0:03:03.413
On the smartphone,

61
0:03:03.413 --> 0:03:05.383
we observed a similar result.

62
0:03:06.890 --> 0:03:09.650
If we go lower precision inference,

63
0:03:09.650 --> 0:03:11.330
as known as quantization,

64
0:03:11.330 --> 0:03:13.450
which is a widely used technique

65
0:03:13.450 --> 0:03:15.990
to optimize the inference performance,

66
0:03:15.990 --> 0:03:20.120
the VNNI and DSP are designed to accelerate that.

67
0:03:20.120 --> 0:03:23.230
So, if using the eigh8 bit precision on the laptop,

68
0:03:23.230 --> 0:03:28.000
the native inference can be 24 times faster than web.

69
0:03:28.000 --> 0:03:28.967
And on the smartphone,

70
0:03:28.967 --> 0:03:33.600
the DSP inference can be 16 times faster than the web.

71
0:03:33.600 --> 0:03:34.970
Slide five.

slide-5
0:03:34.970 --> 0:03:37.800
The JavaScript machine learning frameworks

73
0:03:37.800 --> 0:03:40.660
cannot take advantage of these hardware features,

74
0:03:40.660 --> 0:03:43.450
that leads to the big performance gap.

75
0:03:43.450 --> 0:03:46.620
It would be good to expose them on web platform.

76
0:03:46.620 --> 0:03:49.530
However, due to the architecture diversity

77
0:03:49.530 --> 0:03:51.940
of this new machine learning hardware,

78
0:03:51.940 --> 0:03:54.900
it is quite challenging to expose them

79
0:03:54.900 --> 0:03:58.500
by the general CPU and GPU compute web APIs.

80
0:03:58.500 --> 0:04:02.830
Given that, we are proposing a new domain specific web API

81
0:04:02.830 --> 0:04:06.243
to access the hardware acceleration for machine learning.

82
0:04:07.260 --> 0:04:08.650
Slide six.

slide-6
0:04:08.650 --> 0:04:12.883
The proposal is a Web Neural Network API, known as WebNN.

84
0:04:14.107 --> 0:04:15.520
At the first stage,

85
0:04:15.520 --> 0:04:19.530
it focuses on the hardware acceleration for the inference.

86
0:04:20.270 --> 0:04:23.570
It introduces the primitives of the deep neural network

87
0:04:23.570 --> 0:04:25.000
to the web platform.

88
0:04:25.000 --> 0:04:28.500
The primitives include tensor operant.

89
0:04:28.500 --> 0:04:31.350
Tensor operant represents the multi-dimensional array

90
0:04:31.350 --> 0:04:35.850
in different data type including float point 32, 16,

91
0:04:35.850 --> 0:04:38.130
and integer 32, 8.

92
0:04:39.000 --> 0:04:42.930
The primitives also include a set of tensor operations,

93
0:04:42.930 --> 0:04:46.640
such as convolution, matrix multiplication,

94
0:04:46.640 --> 0:04:49.173
pulling, atom-wise and activation.

95
0:04:50.500 --> 0:04:53.720
These operations are either compute-intensive

96
0:04:53.720 --> 0:04:56.210
or memory bandwidth bounded.

97
0:04:56.210 --> 0:04:57.460
The acceleration of them

98
0:04:57.460 --> 0:05:00.420
is critical to the inference performance.

99
0:05:00.420 --> 0:05:02.260
By using these primitives,

100
0:05:02.260 --> 0:05:04.580
the JavaScript machine learning framework

101
0:05:04.580 --> 0:05:07.120
can define a computational graph.

102
0:05:07.120 --> 0:05:09.680
The graph can represent part or whole

103
0:05:09.680 --> 0:05:12.240
of a machine learning inference model.

104
0:05:12.240 --> 0:05:14.980
Then, the framework can use WebNN API

105
0:05:14.980 --> 0:05:19.410
to compile and execute the graph for hardware acceleration.

106
0:05:19.410 --> 0:05:23.530
The execution of the WebNN graph can interact with kernels

107
0:05:23.530 --> 0:05:27.320
written in WebAssembly or WebGPU compute shader.

108
0:05:27.320 --> 0:05:30.180
With that, the frameworks can be flexible

109
0:05:30.180 --> 0:05:33.250
by using the WebNN for hardware acceleration

110
0:05:33.250 --> 0:05:38.130
and using WebAssembly, WebGPU for custom operation support.

111
0:05:38.130 --> 0:05:40.930
The primitives of WebNN can be mapped

112
0:05:40.930 --> 0:05:43.210
to the native machine learning API

113
0:05:43.210 --> 0:05:46.450
available on different operating systems,

114
0:05:46.450 --> 0:05:51.450
such as Android Neural Network API, DirectML on Windows,

115
0:05:51.630 --> 0:05:56.630
Metal Performance Shader on macOS, iOS, and OpenVINO.

116
0:05:56.940 --> 0:05:59.240
Eventually, these native APIs

117
0:05:59.240 --> 0:06:03.440
will talk with compilers and drivers to run these primitives

118
0:06:03.440 --> 0:06:06.390
on various machine learning hardware.

119
0:06:06.390 --> 0:06:07.223
Slide seven.

slide-7
0:06:08.209 --> 0:06:11.600
WebNN proposal has four major interfaces,

121
0:06:11.600 --> 0:06:13.990
the neural network context, model,

122
0:06:13.990 --> 0:06:16.300
compilation and execution.

123
0:06:16.300 --> 0:06:18.730
The main programming flow is like this:

124
0:06:18.730 --> 0:06:22.230
first, you can get a neural network context object

125
0:06:22.230 --> 0:06:25.000
from the global navigator object.

126
0:06:25.000 --> 0:06:27.000
The neural network context object

127
0:06:27.000 --> 0:06:30.300
has a method of tensor operant and operations,

128
0:06:30.300 --> 0:06:34.250
so you can use that to define the computational graph

129
0:06:34.250 --> 0:06:36.230
as the example shows.

130
0:06:36.230 --> 0:06:39.590
Then, you can create a model object based on this graph.

131
0:06:39.590 --> 0:06:43.810
The model object represents the hardware independent form.

132
0:06:43.810 --> 0:06:45.340
For hardware acceleration,

133
0:06:45.340 --> 0:06:48.200
you need to create a compilation object,

134
0:06:48.200 --> 0:06:52.540
that represents the hardware specific form of this graph.

135
0:06:52.540 --> 0:06:55.770
You can also specify the compilation options,

136
0:06:55.770 --> 0:06:58.800
for example, high performance or low power

137
0:06:58.800 --> 0:07:00.790
so browser and native API

138
0:07:00.790 --> 0:07:03.103
can select an appropriate hardware for you.

139
0:07:04.300 --> 0:07:05.770
After the compilation is done,

140
0:07:05.770 --> 0:07:08.340
you can create the execution object.

141
0:07:08.340 --> 0:07:11.000
That represents the inference request

142
0:07:11.000 --> 0:07:15.300
bound with the specific input and output buffers.

143
0:07:15.300 --> 0:07:17.700
The current spec support CPU buffer.

144
0:07:17.700 --> 0:07:20.820
The GPU buffer and other type of input output

145
0:07:20.820 --> 0:07:23.410
will be supported in the future spec.

146
0:07:23.410 --> 0:07:26.500
Contributions are welcome.

147
0:07:26.500 --> 0:07:30.210
Execution start compute is a synchronous operation,

148
0:07:30.210 --> 0:07:34.530
that will hide the latency for the hardware acceleration.

149
0:07:34.910 --> 0:07:36.660
After the promise is solved,

150
0:07:36.660 --> 0:07:39.553
the result will be put into the output buffer.

151
0:07:40.840 --> 0:07:42.160
Slide eight.

slide-8
0:07:42.160 --> 0:07:43.880
To prove the concept,

153
0:07:43.880 --> 0:07:46.790
we experimentally implemented the WebNN API

154
0:07:46.790 --> 0:07:49.260
in a customized Chromium browser,

155
0:07:49.260 --> 0:07:52.880
we followed the multi-process architecture of Chromium,

156
0:07:52.880 --> 0:07:57.420
we implemented the JavaScript interface of WebNN in Blink

157
0:07:57.420 --> 0:08:01.900
and the native API backend in GPU process.

158
0:08:01.900 --> 0:08:03.260
The two components talk with each other

159
0:08:03.260 --> 0:08:05.770
through the IPC mechanism.

160
0:08:05.770 --> 0:08:09.950
To test the cross-platform interoperability and performance

161
0:08:09.950 --> 0:08:11.890
on different devices,

162
0:08:11.890 --> 0:08:14.500
the prototype support 4 OSs,

163
0:08:14.500 --> 0:08:17.940
including Windows, Android, macOS, and Linux,

164
0:08:17.940 --> 0:08:21.480
and can access the CPU, GPU and accelerators

165
0:08:21.480 --> 0:08:23.720
on smartphone and PC.

166
0:08:23.720 --> 0:08:25.290
Slide nine.

slide-9
0:08:25.290 --> 0:08:28.213
Let's see some demo of the WebNN prototype.

168
0:08:29.780 --> 0:08:30.890
On the laptop,

169
0:08:30.890 --> 0:08:33.290
first, we test the inference performance

170
0:08:33.290 --> 0:08:35.330
with WebAssembly SIMD.

171
0:08:38.720 --> 0:08:42.600
Then we test the performance of WebNN CPU backend

172
0:08:42.600 --> 0:08:44.773
for a float point 32 inference.

173
0:08:49.310 --> 0:08:52.530
At last, we test the performance of WebNN

174
0:08:52.530 --> 0:08:56.243
for integer 8 inference accelerated by VNNI.

175
0:08:57.490 --> 0:08:59.723
It has close-to-native performance.

176
0:09:02.820 --> 0:09:03.680
On the smartphone,

177
0:09:03.680 --> 0:09:06.847
we first tested is a WebGL based inference.

178
0:09:10.570 --> 0:09:14.943
Then, we inference the same model with WebNN GPU backend.

179
0:09:17.780 --> 0:09:21.600
In the last, we use WebNN to access the DSP

180
0:09:21.600 --> 0:09:22.953
for quantized model inference.

181
0:09:23.820 --> 0:09:26.433
It has the near-to-native performance.

182
0:09:27.690 --> 0:09:29.000
Slide 10.

slide-10
0:09:29.000 --> 0:09:32.650
This slide and the next one have the performance numbers

184
0:09:32.650 --> 0:09:37.230
of WebNN prototype we collected on laptop and smartphone.

185
0:09:37.230 --> 0:09:39.570
Feel free to check them out.

186
0:09:39.570 --> 0:09:41.900
As the number shows,

187
0:09:41.900 --> 0:09:44.470
by introducing the domain specific primitives

188
0:09:44.470 --> 0:09:47.950
and relying on the native machine learning API,

189
0:09:47.950 --> 0:09:49.570
WebNN can help access

190
0:09:49.570 --> 0:09:52.110
a purpose-built machine learning hardware

191
0:09:52.110 --> 0:09:55.173
and close the gap between the web and native.

192
0:09:56.334 --> 0:09:57.680
Slide 12.

slide-12
0:09:57.680 --> 0:09:59.360
The Web Neural Network API
