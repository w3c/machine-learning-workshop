slide-1
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.070
<v ->Hello everybody my name is Nikolai</v>

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.570
and I'm a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh.

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.640
Today, I'll be talking to you about our project Bergamot

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.110
which is privacy focused machine translation inside Firefox.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.970
This is a collaboration between Charles University,

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.900
University of Edinburgh, University of Sheffield,

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.930
Tartu University and Mozilla.

slide-2
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.400
Let's start, so the web is huge.

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.380
If you look at the top 10 million webpages language,

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500
about 60% of them are in English,

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.950
then you have Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Persian,

13
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.470
and a very long tail of every other language.

14
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.490
On top of that, we have social media every second,

15
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.150
there's thousands and thousands of social media posts

16
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.200
in the multitude of languages.

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.830
And people nowadays they're used to consuming any content,

18
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.630
regardless of the language that is been produced in.

19
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.820
How do they do that?

slide-3
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.720
They rely on machine translation services,

21
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.160
which are immensely popular everywhere.

22
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.070
There's Google translate, there's Microsoft Bing translate,

23
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.650
there's Facebook translate, there's Baidu translate,

24
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.320
there's many other translation services.

25
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.000
However, they do come with a few issues.

slide-4
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.200
If you use an online translation services,

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.810
you lose your privacy.

28
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.830
Your data goes on the cloud, even if you pay for it.

29
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.280
And when they have your data,

30
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.940
they might accidentally leak it,

31
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.360
like translate.com leaked Statoil's employment contracts.

32
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.110
That's quite embarrassing.

33
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.960
And also you don't know how good a translation is.

34
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.610
If you remember a few years ago,

35
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.140
there was a post in Arabic that said, hello,

36
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.390
and it was translated as kill them all.

37
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.130
That's not good, we shouldn't allow that to happen.

38
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.940
Can we do better than that?

slide-5
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.870
Yes, we can.

40
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.070
We can run the machine translation service locally.

slide-6
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.840
But how do we do that: as far as everybody knows,

42
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.610
machine translation is slow,

43
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.330
it requires heavy duty GPUs,

44
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.900
lots of power, lots of disk space,

45
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.820
but is that really the case?

46
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.160
Not anymore.

slide-7
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.560
A lot of it has changed.

48
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.010
And this is where our project comes in:

49
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.510
Bergamot about building a machine translation service

50
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.290
inside Firefox.

slide-8
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.320
Now for some live demo,

52
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.083
let's go to the nightly build of Firefox,

53
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.740
and we can go to any web page

54
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.393
let's go to the Spanish BBC.

55
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.020
We load the page and then we click translate

56
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.470
and we get a translation.

57
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.283
And then we can click on any webpage.

58
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.370
And then we click translate

59
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.320
and you have a translation in green,

60
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.930
which means that the system is confident

61
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.210
with the translation.

62
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.790
But sometimes when the system is not very confident,

63
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.060
it shows the original in black,

64
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.170
which means that

65
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.850
if the user sees that something is not very certain,

66
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.060
they can check it in a dictionary or something else.

67
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.330
They don't need to rely blinded

68
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.610
on the machine translation software.

69
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.390
We can go to another web page, such as Wikipedia.

70
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.280
We go there, we load it,

71
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.110
we click translate and there we have it.

72
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.100
And we have an article about Lovecraft

73
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.920
we can go on it.

74
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.680
We can click translate,

75
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.320
wait for a second or two, because as you can see,

76
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.923
the webpage is pretty huge,

77
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.980
but we do end up with a translation

78
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.583
in fairly reasonable time.

79
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.200
And yeah, that's it, simple demo.

80
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.900
Let's go back to our presentation.

slide-9
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.340
So, as you saw the translation is quite fast,

82
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.040
but how fast is it exactly?

slide-10
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.740
Well, we benchmark on various different hardware,

84
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.000
and we measured how many source words per second

85
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.650
we can translate.

86
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.440
And I'm running a 2019 desktop,

87
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.090
which can do about 9,000 source words per second,

88
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.090
and then older hardware tested various desktop, laptops

89
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.420
and the slowest one from 2012,

90
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.140
that's 8 years old laptop:

91
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.120
it's about a thousand words per second.

92
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.100
Now I tried very hard to find

93
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.570
what is the typical

94
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.767
number of words in the webpage,

95
00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.943
but there were many conflicting sources.

96
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.240
A lot of them said between 600 and 800 words, it's probably

97
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.960
a reasonable estimate.

98
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.520
And that means that even on an 8 years old hardware,

99
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.023
we can still translate the webpage in about a second.

100
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.200
How we do that?

101
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.800
We did lots of complicated model

102
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.060
and software optimizations.

103
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.963
You can check them out in our WNGT 2020 submission.

slide-11
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.300
Another thing that I didn't demonstrate

105
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.520
is foreign language forms.

106
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.427
A lot of times when you go to a foreign country

107
00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:07.890
and you want to do some service,

108
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.090
you're presented with a form that you need to fill in,

109
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.590
in the foreign language.

110
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.600
Now you can use any translation service to translate

111
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.440
the text on the form,

112
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.890
but you still need to include that language

113
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.860
in order to use it.

114
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.070
So we are going to provide an outbound translation service,

115
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.380
where you enter the text in English,

116
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.270
and then it is going to be translated

117
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.420
in the language that you need for the form.

118
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.730
We are also going to do the same quality estimates so that

119
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.960
when you see that the system is not very confident

120
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.110
with translating your input,

121
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.620
you can rephrase it and it can try again.

slide-12
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.390
And yeah, that's it.

slide-13
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.180
Machine translation is no longer just in the cloud

124
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.180
you can now use it locally and securely inside Firefox.


00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.469
And that's it, thank you for your time.
