00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.296
<v ->Hi, I'd like to dive straight into this discussion</v>

2
00:00:10.296 --> 00:00:13.046
on privacy first machine learning for web applications,

3
00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.106
by outlining why I feel machine learning for the web

4
00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:16.659
is an essential feature.

5
00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:18.689
Slide two.

slide-2
00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:22.826
Accessibility is part of a wider effort

7
00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:25.246
to make applications more inclusive.

8
00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.086
By inclusively taking into account

9
00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:28.506
the various diverse individuals

10
00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:29.906
using our software and hardware

11
00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:31.146
and making sure there are equal

12
00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:33.846
and fair access without barriers.

13
00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:35.836
It's inclusive as it takes in both short term

14
00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:37.886
and long term accessibility concerns,

15
00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.286
but when we look into these aspects,

16
00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:41.546
we're often looking at physical considerations only,

17
00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:44.696
such as visual or limb impairments.

18
00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:46.194
Although considerations outside the physical

19
00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:48.736
are often ignored when we're examining inclusivity,

20
00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.556
and this can sometimes mean individuals

21
00:00:50.556 --> 00:00:51.616
with diverse backgrounds

22
00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:53.589
are left behind when we build software.

23
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.076
Slide three.

slide-3
00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.986
Take an application that is large and slow to load,

25
00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:01.705
we'll build it, we can consider the market demographics

26
00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:05.626
which devices, operating systems and browsers to support.

27
00:01:05.626 --> 00:01:09.386
Well, this is at its most fundamental financially driven.

28
00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:11.576
Of course, there's always a cost and overturn attributes

29
00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:12.936
to most development efforts,

30
00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:16.066
even if the cost is measured in time rather than money.

31
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.206
With the web we have a partial solution to this issue

32
00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:19.856
with progressive enhancement.

33
00:01:19.856 --> 00:01:22.696
We can deliver content easily, and we have been for decades,

34
00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:24.566
enabling delivery of most web applications

35
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.276
without it being necessary to bundle heavy assets.

36
00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:29.307
Those assets are often enhancements to a product

37
00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:31.096
but not essential.

38
00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:32.856
Slide four.

slide-4
00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:34.996
We can mitigate issues with underpowered hardware

40
00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:36.526
and underdelivered infrastructure

41
00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:38.566
by focusing on content delivery first

42
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.036
and content enhancements second.

43
00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:43.266
Although we can look at simple metrics like bandwidth,

44
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.966
latency and feature availability,

45
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.516
which typically is indicative of a browser version,

46
00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:49.646
we should be understanding the human side of this,

47
00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:51.876
typically smaller bandwidth, larger latency

48
00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:54.846
and older browsers support is indicative of less wealth.

49
00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:56.636
So by excluding those demographics

50
00:01:56.636 --> 00:01:59.716
to reduce development costs no matter how small the market,

51
00:01:59.716 --> 00:02:02.936
you're excluding poor individuals from your content.

52
00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.866
Slide five.

slide-5
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:07.266
This is directly against web accessibility initiative's

54
00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.026
goals and accessibility, usability and inclusion.

55
00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:12.056
The web is designed with accessibility in mind

56
00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:14.336
with varying degrees of success.

57
00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:15.169
Slide six.

slide-6
00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:18.646
So this is where mobile applications differ.

59
00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:20.516
Consumer electronics have a premium

60
00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:22.586
and an inherent exclusivity,

61
00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:24.890
sure they have great support for accessibility features,

62
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.656
but they lack some of the core benefits of the web,

63
00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:30.186
they're typically not great at backwards compatibility,

64
00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:31.596
whereas web development is considered

65
00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:34.159
of not breaking experiences as standards evolve.

66
00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:36.916
If we want to deliver on a lot of old

67
00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:39.146
or less expensive handsets with native code,

68
00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:41.366
we have to support all the APIs,

69
00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:43.276
and in some cases divergent code bases,

70
00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:45.566
which becomes incredibly costly.

71
00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:46.676
Weighing up the cost benefits

72
00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:48.266
of developing to a particular handset

73
00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:50.636
is entirely justifiable to most projects,

74
00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:52.716
and mobile prices reflect this discrepancy

75
00:02:52.716 --> 00:02:54.776
in quality of content.

76
00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:57.406
The solution to this legacy support issue for developers

77
00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:00.046
can often be to go web first:

78
00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.176
deliver the content, enhance the content

79
00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:03.376
and then deliver a native app

80
00:03:03.376 --> 00:03:06.476
if it makes sense for specific features or markets.

81
00:03:06.476 --> 00:03:09.166
Of course, I am simplifying a complex discussion here

82
00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:11.306
and so much don't fit into that categorization.

83
00:03:11.306 --> 00:03:14.406
And native apps sometimes come first.

84
00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:16.906
And this is often the case with games for example.

85
00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:18.949
Slide seven.

slide-7
00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:23.506
Privacy is often a marketable feature of a product.

87
00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:26.236
Company sell privacy as value added feature all the time.

88
00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:28.536
There's pro versions of apps that are definitively apps

89
00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:30.426
that don't have advertising built in.

90
00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:32.606
And we know advertisements often come with tracking codes.

91
00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:33.886
So for the sake of simplicity,

92
00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:36.346
we can assume ads and trackers are one and the same.

93
00:03:36.346 --> 00:03:37.339
Slide eight.

slide-8
00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:40.666
This isn't a criticism of advertisements

95
00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:41.946
that advertisement is slow.

96
00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:45.156
If ads were delivered in an absolutely privacy friendly way,

97
00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:47.836
and user experience wasn't reduced due to increased latency

98
00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:49.776
or broken accessibility features,

99
00:03:49.776 --> 00:03:52.306
then there'd be little to complain about.

100
00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:54.626
When you position privacy as a luxury,

101
00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:56.476
then you're valuing it as a convenience.

102
00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:58.546
This is a naive and privileged view of privacy

103
00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:00.976
and exclusionary at best.

104
00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:02.336
Without going into real cases

105
00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:03.906
where weakened privacy has a lethal or

106
00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:05.596
material impact on lives,

107
00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:07.036
let's realize this view of privacy

108
00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:08.896
is often taken from people in the tech industry

109
00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:11.246
who are privileged enough to earn a decent salary,

110
00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:12.516
and can afford to make a decision

111
00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:14.679
on if and when to give up their data.

112
00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:18.476
By default into the stance that privacy is a commodity

113
00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:20.736
and data is tradable like oil,

114
00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:22.686
we're defaulting our products to be exclusive

115
00:04:22.686 --> 00:04:26.286
and favoring privacy as a convenience which costs extra.

116
00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:29.346
This is exploitative in most markets as in many cases,

117
00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:31.276
individuals will opt for a free service

118
00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:33.626
and give up their privacy if given the choice,

119
00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:36.026
and many don't have a choice in the first place.

120
00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:38.916
Slide nine.

slide-9
00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:40.926
Let's take a look at how privacy has negatively affected

122
00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:42.966
the user experience on the web for a moment.

123
00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:44.766
Slide 10.

slide-10
00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:46.916
With EU increasingly adding privacy protections

125
00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:47.926
into legislation,

126
00:04:47.926 --> 00:04:50.286
web developers have devised annoying modal dialogues

127
00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:51.636
which request numerous opt ins

128
00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:54.346
to enable trackers in a legally friendly way.

129
00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:56.356
Many developers have taken issue with the EU law

130
00:04:56.356 --> 00:04:57.416
and have aggressively argued that

131
00:04:57.416 --> 00:05:00.636
it's only way to deliver web apps to the European market.

132
00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:02.586
Many of the apps featuring these modal dialogues

133
00:05:02.586 --> 00:05:04.996
have nothing to do with advertisements or e-commerce.

134
00:05:04.996 --> 00:05:07.216
Developers are simply defaulting to tracking users

135
00:05:07.216 --> 00:05:08.056
on a first load,

136
00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:09.886
and are reducing the quality of the user experience

137
00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:10.943
of your apps along the way,

138
00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.456
due to laziness, not legislation.

139
00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:14.489
Slide 10.

140
00:05:15.746 --> 00:05:18.246
You can't deliver advertisements without tracking.

141
00:05:19.696 --> 00:05:21.136
So if you're monetized by ads,

142
00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:22.636
you don't need to destroy your user experience

143
00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:23.736
along the way.

144
00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:25.506
If you're monetized by data and tracking,

145
00:05:25.506 --> 00:05:27.806
then it's time to rethink your business model.

146
00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:31.106
How will the web look without base monetization,

147
00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:33.766
but no tracking or data gathering, for example?

148
00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.196
Essentially it would look the same,

149
00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:38.196
but without the annoying needless modal dialogues.

150
00:05:38.196 --> 00:05:40.016
As developers were to blame, not the EU,

151
00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:41.686
California or the end users,

152
00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.639
we as developers need to do better.

153
00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:45.559
Slide 11.

slide-11
00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:49.386
So how does this affect machine learning?

155
00:05:49.386 --> 00:05:51.772
This is where mobile apps can only be much better.

156
00:05:51.772 --> 00:05:54.176
We have the capability due to hardware access

157
00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:56.016
to deliver personalization on mobile apps

158
00:05:56.016 --> 00:05:58.216
using machine learning.

159
00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:00.036
Slide 12.

slide-12
00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:01.966
We can currently build offline enabled models

161
00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:04.006
with tooling and bundle them with our apps

162
00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:05.536
enabling personalized experiences

163
00:06:05.536 --> 00:06:06.836
by learning about the end user

164
00:06:06.836 --> 00:06:08.766
without sending data anywhere.

165
00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:10.326
We can even add differential privacy

166
00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:11.486
and federation tool models,

167
00:06:11.486 --> 00:06:12.848
features also available in edge devices

168
00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:14.876
and internet of things.

169
00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:17.086
This means we can do clever personalized analytics

170
00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:18.926
without looking at data.

171
00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:20.036
And the worst we would need to do

172
00:06:20.036 --> 00:06:21.776
is send the model weights towards services

173
00:06:21.776 --> 00:06:23.956
for federation before updating the model again.

174
00:06:23.956 --> 00:06:25.826
We're not transferring data here,

175
00:06:25.826 --> 00:06:27.916
we're transferring anonymous weights only.

176
00:06:27.916 --> 00:06:30.186
This means mobile apps can create much better experiences

177
00:06:30.186 --> 00:06:32.239
than web apps when privacy is valued.

178
00:06:33.106 --> 00:06:34.736
In this way the web is far behind

179
00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:36.386
in terms of privacy features.

180
00:06:36.386 --> 00:06:38.806
It doesn't matter what cookie protections, tracking blockers

181
00:06:38.806 --> 00:06:41.306
or anonymization features you attempt to build in,

182
00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:44.726
if you're lazily transferring data to a central resource,

183
00:06:44.726 --> 00:06:46.699
you're probably not privacy enabled.

184
00:06:49.316 --> 00:06:51.426
Take for example, those privacy aware solutions

185
00:06:51.426 --> 00:06:53.186
that hash an individual's email address

186
00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:55.146
@@@ storing it in plain text.

187
00:06:55.146 --> 00:06:56.306
When the information leaks,

188
00:06:56.306 --> 00:06:59.556
there's no personal identifiable information, right?

189
00:06:59.556 --> 00:07:02.052
Well, as most developers use the same hashing algorithms,

190
00:07:02.052 --> 00:07:04.446
there's a good chance you can connect disparate sources

191
00:07:04.446 --> 00:07:07.036
of data together to form a rather solid picture of someone,

192
00:07:07.036 --> 00:07:09.326
hashes are not the finishing line for privacy,

193
00:07:09.326 --> 00:07:11.756
they're hardly the starting line.

194
00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:12.949
Slide 13.

slide-13
00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:16.136
Let's segue into looking at most machine learning

196
00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:17.546
infrastructure currently powering

197
00:07:17.546 --> 00:07:20.196
moderately successful web apps for a moment.

198
00:07:20.196 --> 00:07:21.029
Slide 14.

slide-14
00:07:22.318 --> 00:07:24.606
Typically these days we're building data warehouses,

200
00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:27.106
data lakes, to support data aggregation, analysis,

201
00:07:27.106 --> 00:07:28.996
model building and deployment.

202
00:07:28.996 --> 00:07:29.829
At various scales,

203
00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:31.626
this architecture is essentially ubiquitous

204
00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:32.986
and has been for some time,

205
00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:36.086
whether you're building one model or a 1000 models.

206
00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:38.076
This architecture is lazy,

207
00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:39.606
most developers will take this blueprint

208
00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:42.146
and continue to implement it are lazy,

209
00:07:42.146 --> 00:07:43.336
it's commercially focused,

210
00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:46.376
it's driven by an @@@ of the data can be collected,

211
00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:47.476
and the models that can be built

212
00:07:47.476 --> 00:07:49.766 
with the analytics dashboards that can be provided.

213
00:07:49.766 --> 00:07:51.456
But it's not driven by the end user,

214
00:07:51.456 --> 00:07:54.816
it's not driven by individuals, and it's not driven by humans.

215
00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:56.426
It's also expensive in the long term,

216
00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:58.199
but that's another discussion.

217
00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.716
Slide 15.

slide-15
00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:02.506
So what does good data science architecture

219
00:08:02.506 --> 00:08:04.196
look like for the web?

220
00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:06.706
Firstly, like apps it should be privacy first.

221
00:08:06.706 --> 00:08:08.126
We shouldn't be vacuuming data

222
00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:10.126
and then attempt to apply anonymization techniques

223
00:08:10.126 --> 00:08:11.536
to that data.

224
00:08:11.536 --> 00:08:12.746
That's like committing a crime

225
00:08:12.746 --> 00:08:14.026
and then bleaching the hotel room.

226
00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:15.726
I swear, if you go in with a UV light,

227
00:08:15.726 --> 00:08:18.556
you'll still find evidence, no matter how hard you worked.

228
00:08:18.556 --> 00:08:20.056
So let's stop trying to fix the data

229
00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:21.706
and fix the architecture instead.

230
00:08:22.756 --> 00:08:24.306
Slide 16.

slide-16
00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:26.616
Differential privacy is a great tool if applied correctly,

232
00:08:26.616 --> 00:08:28.126
but it's still not the first feature

233
00:08:28.126 --> 00:08:29.926
we should be looking at.

234
00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.236
Decentralization, distribution and federation

235
00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:34.816
are modern approaches to data science architecture.

236
00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:36.956
They provide the best features to the end user,

237
00:08:36.956 --> 00:08:38.896
including protection by default,

238
00:08:38.896 --> 00:08:41.256
and they give just a little more work.

239
00:08:41.256 --> 00:08:43.286
Now, this may be hard for a lot of developers

240
00:08:43.286 --> 00:08:44.346
and data scientists to hear,

241
00:08:44.346 --> 00:08:46.136
but we're meant to be doing that hard work.

242
00:08:46.136 --> 00:08:47.176
That's what programming is,

243
00:08:47.176 --> 00:08:50.916
reducing the complexity of a set of tasks for the end user.

244
00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:53.216
So what does this approach give us?

245
00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:55.396
It enables us to run inferences on edge devices

246
00:08:55.396 --> 00:08:58.176
and in some cases it allows us to run some of the training,

247
00:08:58.176 --> 00:08:59.061
while some infrastructure is there

248
00:08:59.061 --> 00:09:01.456
to give you heavy lifting only.

249
00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:03.126
If we distributed the training workload

250
00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.516
we can even reduce data IO

251
00:09:04.516 --> 00:09:06.386
by mitigating the need to centrally store

252
00:09:06.386 --> 00:09:08.586
in some gigantic data lake.

253
00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:10.226
And data lakes have their uses,

254
00:09:10.226 --> 00:09:11.596
but they're often overuses,

255
00:09:11.596 --> 00:09:14.596
when all we really need to know is about events and weights.

256
00:09:15.796 --> 00:09:17.676
Slide 17.

slide-17
00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:19.626
Whenever ML operations are first class features

258
00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:21.016
of the modern web browser,

259
00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:22.826
we can add progressive enhancement to our apps

260
00:09:22.826 --> 00:09:25.109
by allowing models to be executed within the browser

261
00:09:25.109 --> 00:09:27.856
using the best available hardware.

262
00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:30.166
Architecturally, our browser becomes our OS device

263
00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:31.016
in this ideal,

264
00:09:31.016 --> 00:09:32.346
and we can also offload some the inference

265
00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:34.726
from the legacy central platform to the end user,

266
00:09:34.726 --> 00:09:37.016
providing them with added privacy, more responsive resources

267
00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:39.496
and more personalized experiences.

268
00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.146
We can also reuse the same models

269
00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:43.346
that we've been building in mobile apps.

270
00:09:43.346 --> 00:09:44.439
Slide 18.

slide-18
00:09:45.496 --> 00:09:47.496
By bringing browsers in line with native apps

272
00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:49.606
in terms of model inference capabilities,

273
00:09:49.606 --> 00:09:51.156
by optimizing usage of hardware

274
00:09:51.156 --> 00:09:53.316
like central graphics and neural processing units

275
00:09:53.316 --> 00:09:54.566
to process models,

276
00:09:54.566 --> 00:09:57.846
it allows us to build more inclusive solutions,

277
00:09:57.846 --> 00:10:00.286
without which we can't build truly privacy friendly

278
00:10:00.286 --> 00:10:02.916
and machine learning powered apps.

279
00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:03.976
It lowers the cost of entry

280
00:10:03.976 --> 00:10:05.826
from a latest luxury electronic device

281
00:10:05.826 --> 00:10:07.756
to a favorite free browser download,

282
00:10:07.756 --> 00:10:09.356
and this is key to ensuring the web

283
00:10:09.356 --> 00:10:11.619
is a free and safe ecosystem for everyone.

slide-19
00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:13.706
Thank you for listening.
