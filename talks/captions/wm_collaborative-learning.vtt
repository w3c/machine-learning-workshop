0:00:08.490 --> 0:00:09.630
<v ->Hello everybody,</v>

2
0:00:09.630 --> 0:00:11.800
my name is Wolfgang Maß.

3
0:00:11.800 --> 0:00:13.180
I am at the German Research Center

4
0:00:13.180 --> 0:00:15.600
for Artificial Intelligence.

5
0:00:15.600 --> 0:00:19.930
And I'm working on smart service engineering,

6
0:00:20.300 --> 0:00:24.753
in industrial settings, healthcare settings and other domains.

7
0:00:25.700 --> 0:00:28.950
I want to show what we are doing

8
0:00:28.950 --> 0:00:32.460
with respect to what we call collaborative learning

9
0:00:32.460 --> 0:00:34.673
in the next couple of slides.

slide-2
0:00:36.920 --> 0:00:39.630
So, a background motivation for work

11
0:00:39.630 --> 0:00:42.990
is that we are investigating smart services,

12
0:00:42.990 --> 0:00:46.200
which can be considered as software systems

13
0:00:46.200 --> 0:00:49.000
that adapt to user needs and are adaptive

14
0:00:49.000 --> 0:00:52.530
to various kinds of contexts in the real world.

15
0:00:52.530 --> 0:00:57.520
And smart services apply AI technologies,

16
0:00:57.520 --> 0:01:02.520
processing box data, but also streaming data

17
0:01:03.800 --> 0:01:06.340
and smart services shall be interoperable

18
0:01:06.340 --> 0:01:09.420
and shall collaborate over the network

19
0:01:09.420 --> 0:01:11.200
in particular the world wide web.

20
0:01:12.170 --> 0:01:16.373
There are some goals that we investigate on one hand side:

21
0:01:17.270 --> 0:01:20.570
we want to investigate smart services

22
0:01:20.570 --> 0:01:25.570
that only live in a browser and not so much in data centers.

23
0:01:27.900 --> 0:01:31.650
Smart services shall be quickly built

24
0:01:31.650 --> 0:01:36.650
and shall be based on reusable software modules.

25
0:01:38.400 --> 0:01:43.400
We do not want to exclude cloud based AI services,

26
0:01:44.210 --> 0:01:48.800
but want to merge locally executed AI services

27
0:01:48.800 --> 0:01:51.223
and cloud based AI services.

28
0:01:52.900 --> 0:01:53.630
And another goal is

29
0:01:53.630 --> 0:01:56.583
that smart services are self-descriptive,

30
0:01:57.490 --> 0:02:01.300
and in this sense of self-containing.

31
0:02:01.300 --> 0:02:06.300
And then it shall be self maintaining to a certain extent,

32
0:02:06.270 --> 0:02:08.680
while this at the moment is rather a goal

33
0:02:08.680 --> 0:02:11.713
than that we actually have implementations on that.

34
0:02:13.330 --> 0:02:18.330
Furthermore, we do not want to confine ourselves

35
0:02:18.860 --> 0:02:21.810
toward very specific architecture,

36
0:02:21.810 --> 0:02:25.260
but by adopting an agent based approach,

37
0:02:25.260 --> 0:02:28.560
agents shall communicate with each other,

38
0:02:28.560 --> 0:02:31.990
they should also dedicate roles

39
0:02:31.990 --> 0:02:36.450
to agents such as becoming a server role

40
0:02:36.450 --> 0:02:38.400
or communication partner role,

41
0:02:38.400 --> 0:02:41.620
and that should be done dynamically

42
0:02:41.620 --> 0:02:44.703
in negotiation between agents.

43
0:02:47.000 --> 0:02:49.770
We have built a platform called Tucana,

44
0:02:49.770 --> 0:02:52.390
whose architecture you see on the right hand side

45
0:02:52.390 --> 0:02:53.650
of the slide.

46
0:02:53.650 --> 0:02:57.500
And Tucana is a peer to peer architecture,

47
0:02:57.500 --> 0:02:59.900
where different kinds of environments

48
0:02:59.900 --> 0:03:02.210
what we call Tucana environments T-ENV,

49
0:03:02.210 --> 0:03:04.580
can communicate with one another.

50
0:03:04.580 --> 0:03:06.960
In each Tucana environment,

51
0:03:06.960 --> 0:03:10.460
several smart services can be executed.

52
0:03:10.460 --> 0:03:13.100
They can communicate locally,

53
0:03:13.100 --> 0:03:15.560
but they can also communicate

54
0:03:15.560 --> 0:03:18.873
via peer to peer networks based on WebRTC.

55
0:03:19.790 --> 0:03:24.320
Each smart service as you can see on the second image

56
0:03:24.320 --> 0:03:28.780
on this slide, consists of different kinds of minions

57
0:03:28.780 --> 0:03:33.780
and these minions are software modules with dedicated tasks.

58
0:03:34.800 --> 0:03:36.760
We distinguish between perceiver minions,

59
0:03:36.760 --> 0:03:39.900
thinker minions, communicator minions,

60
0:03:39.900 --> 0:03:42.730
but also actuator minions.

61
0:03:42.730 --> 0:03:45.860
The basic minions according to a three layer architecture

62
0:03:45.860 --> 0:03:49.170
are perceiver minions (PMINs) and thinker minions

63
0:03:49.170 --> 0:03:50.910
and communicator minions.

64
0:03:50.910 --> 0:03:53.650
Perceiver minion collects data

65
0:03:53.650 --> 0:03:57.640
and stores the data in the local database of the browser.

66
0:03:57.640 --> 0:04:00.800
Thinker minion accesses the data

67
0:04:00.800 --> 0:04:05.800
and processes by leveraging data analytical software,

68
0:04:05.130 --> 0:04:07.190
in particular TensorFlow-based

69
0:04:07.190 --> 0:04:09.860
kind of analytics but could be any kind of

70
0:04:09.860 --> 0:04:14.860
JavaScript machine learning software or customized software,

71
0:04:16.700 --> 0:04:19.890
while the communicator minion either communicates

72
0:04:19.890 --> 0:04:23.900
with other smart services locally

73
0:04:23.900 --> 0:04:26.360
via peer to peer network globally,

74
0:04:26.360 --> 0:04:29.993
or with the end user via the browser interface.

75
0:04:31.890 --> 0:04:36.890
We are using JavaScript for all our implementation, WebRTC.

76
0:04:37.380 --> 0:04:42.360
For access control we use OpenAuthentication 2.0,

77
0:04:42.360 --> 0:04:47.800
we are able to export the data that we collect into JSON-LD,

78
0:04:47.800 --> 0:04:49.700
one implementation is using BabelNet

79
0:04:49.700 --> 0:04:52.970
as the transformer basis.

80
0:04:52.970 --> 0:04:55.390
We also leverage TensorFlow

81
0:04:55.390 --> 0:04:59.870
and we are compliant with the specification of GAIA-X

82
0:04:59.870 --> 0:05:03.620
and the International Data Space  which is

83
0:05:04.600 --> 0:05:07.700
a widely used kind of specification

84
0:05:07.700 --> 0:05:11.910
for Industry 4.0 applications, yes.

85
0:05:11.910 --> 0:05:16.910
So, we specify the smart services in JSON format,

86
0:05:19.330 --> 0:05:24.500
and we use these JSON formats in order to bind

87
0:05:25.400 --> 0:05:29.960
the software configuration, the smart service configuration

88
0:05:29.960 --> 0:05:32.993
to pre-installed minions.

89
0:05:34.130 --> 0:05:36.730
Probably more interesting for this workshop

90
0:05:36.730 --> 0:05:38.780
is the thinker minion.

91
0:05:38.780 --> 0:05:42.500
I have here an example that we use for activity recognition

92
0:05:42.500 --> 0:05:44.133
in the shopping context.

93
0:05:44.970 --> 0:05:48.230
You also see here that the minions again

94
0:05:48.230 --> 0:05:52.210
have an activate method,  a notify method

95
0:05:52.210 --> 0:05:53.863
and a terminate method.

96
0:05:55.500 --> 0:05:59.510
But in between we also have a method for predictPartially

97
0:05:59.510 --> 0:06:03.690
the data that is coming in and streams for the acceleration

98
0:06:03.690 --> 0:06:08.690
and the geolocation is used to make predictions.

99
0:06:10.700 --> 0:06:15.700
And we are using a model that was pre-trained

100
0:06:17.750 --> 0:06:19.500
in the server side.

101
0:06:19.500 --> 0:06:23.500
And in during the activate method,

102
0:06:23.500 --> 0:06:27.700
we load that model and we use it to make predictions.

103
0:06:27.700 --> 0:06:30.160
In this case it is a very straightforward

104
0:06:30.160 --> 0:06:33.940
and simple prediction - simply to say that a person is tired

105
0:06:33.940 --> 0:06:35.460
or it's not tired.

106
0:06:35.460 --> 0:06:40.460
And the integration of TensorFlow JS works quite nicely.

107
0:06:42.400 --> 0:06:45.900
On the right hand side, you see the model topology

108
0:06:45.900 --> 0:06:50.433
that we use here is based on LSTM layers,

109
0:06:52.690 --> 0:06:54.760
and the fully connected layer

110
0:06:54.760 --> 0:06:57.570
and we integrate it all together

111
0:06:57.570 --> 0:07:01.143
and push that into our TMIN.

112
0:07:02.510 --> 0:07:06.683
Here is an example for the whole smart service for shopping,

113
0:07:07.640 --> 0:07:09.770
and as you can see on the left hand side

114
0:07:09.770 --> 0:07:14.540
we have a configuration file for our smart service

115
0:07:14.540 --> 0:07:18.800
that says we have two perceiver minions,

116
0:07:18.800 --> 0:07:21.530
one for geolocation and the other for linear acceleration.

117
0:07:21.530 --> 0:07:26.000
We have one TMIN for activity prediction

118
0:07:26.000 --> 0:07:28.203
and  three CMINs.

119
0:07:29.520 --> 0:07:34.520
The one for communicating with the user for shopping deal

120
0:07:35.590 --> 0:07:38.430
that might be appropriate in that situation.

121
0:07:39.130 --> 0:07:42.440
We have a pure communicator that can pass

122
0:07:43.840 --> 0:07:48.840
information to internal locally defined

123
0:07:48.920 --> 0:07:51.210
or via peer to peer connection

124
0:07:51.210 --> 0:07:55.900
also to external smart services.

125
0:07:55.900 --> 0:07:59.190
And we have another communication minion

126
0:07:59.190 --> 0:08:03.430
that shows the acceleration also to the user.

127
0:08:04.120 --> 0:08:07.490
And this configuration in JSON is very handy

128
0:08:07.490 --> 0:08:11.960
and allows us very similar to the architectural

129
0:08:11.960 --> 0:08:14.370
and topology of a machine learning model

130
0:08:14.370 --> 0:08:18.543
to define smart service designs.

131
0:08:20.570 --> 0:08:23.593
Okay, so let's wrap it up.

132
0:08:24.510 --> 0:08:26.710
What are our lessons learned?

133
0:08:26.710 --> 0:08:31.290
And where do we see potential for further development

134
0:08:31.290 --> 0:08:32.633
and specifications?

135
0:08:33.820 --> 0:08:37.570
First, it  would be interesting to have

136
0:08:37.570 --> 0:08:40.480
agent-oriented architecture,

137
0:08:40.480 --> 0:08:45.180
better being supported by current systems

138
0:08:45.180 --> 0:08:50.180
in JavaScript, by WebRTC and by other technologies.

139
0:08:50.450 --> 0:08:52.550
That's one element.

140
0:08:52.550 --> 0:08:55.140
Then, on the machine learning side,

141
0:08:55.140 --> 0:08:59.290
it would be really great if also on the JavaScript side,

142
0:08:59.290 --> 0:09:02.440
we would have some support for federated learning,

143
0:09:02.440 --> 0:09:06.590
distributed learning and reinforcement learning,

144
0:09:06.590 --> 0:09:07.423
this is currently missing.

145
0:09:07.423 --> 0:09:12.359
In WebRTC, I know that the signaling service

146
0:09:13.220 --> 0:09:16.440
and the protocol is outside of webRTC.

147
0:09:16.440 --> 0:09:18.150
However, I would appreciate

148
0:09:18.150 --> 0:09:21.540
and I think the community would also appreciate

149
0:09:21.540 --> 0:09:24.650
a general and optimized signaling protocol,

150
0:09:24.650 --> 0:09:29.650
maybe also an environment for testing for signaling services.

151
0:09:31.119 --> 0:09:35.830
And last but not least, OpenAuthentication 2.0 - 

152
0:09:35.830 --> 0:09:38.850
it requires always on at the moment,

153
0:09:38.850 --> 0:09:43.850
if you are offline authentication is a pain.

154
0:09:43.910 --> 0:09:46.480
So, you have to switch it on and off.

155
0:09:46.480 --> 0:09:49.460
A buffering service for authentication

156
0:09:49.460 --> 0:09:54.403
that supports offline services would be really appreciated.
