          <p>
            W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and
            communities to help structure productive discussions around
            existing and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free
            patent framework for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on
            client-side (browser) technologies, and also have a mature history
            of vocabulary (or ‚Äúontology‚Äù) development. W3C develops work based
            on the priorities of our members and our community.
