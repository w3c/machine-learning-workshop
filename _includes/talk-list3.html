She has more than five years of product experience in search engine taking advantage of machine learning techniques and spent more than three years exploring AI adoption among various businesses. She is passionate about bringing AI solutions to solve business problems as well as enhance product experience.</dd><dt>Abstract</dt><dd>    ONNX.js is a Javascript library for running ONNX models on browsers and on Node.js, on both CPU and GPU. Thanks to ONNX interoperability, it’s also compatible with Tensorflow and Pytroch. For running on CPU, ONNX.js adopts WebAssembly to execute the model at near-native speed and utilizes Web Workers to provide a “multi-threaded” environment, achieving very promising performance gains. For running on GPU, ONNX.js takes advantage of WebGL which is a popular standard for accessing GPU capabilities. By reducing data transfer between CPU and GPU as well as GPU processing cycles, ONNX.js further push the performance to the maximum.</dd></dl></details>
