<p>People with lived experience of disability are the stress testers of our systems, including the web.</p>
<p>They are the canaries in the coal mine for things that will go wrong.</p>
<p>The flip side of this is that considering disability offers the innovative choices that may help us fix the cracks and shortcomings for everyone.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 3 of 39" id="slide-3" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/jt_ai-bias.pdf#page=3"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/jt_ai-bias.pdf#page=3">Slide 3</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>The late Stephen Hawking predicted that we were entering a dangerous time.</p>

<p>There are three main sources of a discrimination.</p>
<p>Discrimination may happen because of data gaps because people are not represented in data gathering.</p>
<p>They may have no digital traces because of digital exclusion.</p>
<p>Or inaccurate data proxies are used.</p>
<p>Data may also be misinterpreted as noise and eliminated to improve performance.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is algorithmic bias and this can result from human bias that finds its way into algorithms due to labeling analysis and interpretation that is used or it can be due to biased training data.</p>
<p>The much more fundamental discrimination faced by small minorities and outliers, including people with disabilities is the inherent bias in our statistical methods and how we treat minorities and outliers.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 15 of 39" id="slide-15" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/jt_ai-bias.pdf#page=15"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/jt_ai-bias.pdf#page=15">Slide 15</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>The measures we use to assess AI ethics do no cover the discrimination faced by people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The primary tools for detecting bias is to compare the treatment of bounded identity groups with a default.</p>

<p>The only common data characteristic is distance from the mean, such that things don't work for you.</p>
