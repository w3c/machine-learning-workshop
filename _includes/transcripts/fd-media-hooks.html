<p>I'm François Daoust.</p>
<p>I work for W3C where I keep track of media related activities.</p>
<p>The goal of this presentation is to take a peak at mechanisms that allow,or will allow, media processing on the Web.</p>
<p>I will very hardly touch on machine learning per se, just as a possible approach that people might want to apply to process media.</p></div><div class="slide" id="media-scenarios" role="region" aria-label="Slide 2 of 18">

    </dl>
  </div><div role='region'><p>In the past few years, I would say that standardization has enabled 4 different media scenarios on the Web.</p>
<p>First one is support for basic media playback, also known as progressive media playback, in other words the ability to play a simple media file.</p>
<p>This was enabled by the audio and video tags in HTML and the underlying HTMLMediaElement interface.</p>
<p>Second scenario is support for adaptive media playback.</p>
<p>Here, the goal is to adjust video parameters (typically, the resolution) in real time to the user's current environment.</p>
<p>This scenario was enabled by Media Source Extensions or MSE for short.</p>
<p>It brought professional and commercial media content to the Web.</p>
<p>MSE is, by far, the main mechanism used to stream on-demand media content on the Web today.</p>
<p>Third media scenario is different.</p>
<p>It is about real-time audio/video conversations.</p>
<p>This was enabled by <a class=dfn>WebRTC</a>.</p>
<p>And <a class=dfn>WebRTC</a> is also used to stream media in scenarios that require latency to be minimal, for instance cloud gaming.</p>
<p>Fourth media scenario is also completely different.</p>
<p>It is about synthesized audio playback: to generate music, or sound effects in games for instance.</p>
<p>This was enabled by the Web Audio API.</p></div><div class="slide" id="content" role="region" aria-label="Slide 3 of 18">

    <h1>Media encoding/decoding pipeline</h1>
    <img src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/fd-media-processing/pipeline.svg" alt="In a typical media pipeline, media content first gets recorded from a camera or microphone. This creates a raw stream of audio/video frames. These raw frames are then encoded to save memory and bandwidth, and multiplexed (also known as muxed) to mix related audio/video/text tracks before the result may be sent over the network, either directly to a receiving peer or to a server. The decoding side is roughly symmetric. Media content needs to be fetched, demuxed, decoded to produce raw audio and video frames, and rendered to the final display or speakers.">

    <h1>Processing hooks needed!</h1>

    <img src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/fd-media-processing/pipeline-processing.svg" alt="Most media processing scenarios need processing hooks either on the encoder side between the record and encode operations, or on the decoder side between the decode and render operations.">
  </div><div role='region'><p>In most cases, these scenarios need to process individual decoded audio or video frames.</p>

  </div><div role='region'><p>OK, let's get back to our four media scenarios.</p>
<p>For progressive media playback, the HTMLMediaElement takes the URL of a media file and renders the result.</p>
<p>The browser does all the work.</p>

<p>You create your own processing hook.</p>

<p>This is suboptimal, especially on constrained devices, but know that some media authoring applications actually do that.</p></div><div class="slide" id="efficient" role="region" aria-label="Slide 14 of 18">
    <h1>Main requirements for efficient media processing</h1>
    <p class="note">Raw data processing needs:<br>
      1 video frame in a HD video ≈ 1920x1080 x 3 components x 4 bytes ≈ <b>24MB</b><br>
      1 second of HD video ≈ 25 * 24MB ≈ <b>600MB</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid copies in/across memory (e.g. CPU, GPU, Worker, WebAssembly)</li>
      <li>Expose as raw data as possible (e.g. YUV or ARGB for decoded video)</li>
      <li>Leverage processing power (e.g. workers, WebAssembly, GPU, <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr>)</li>
      <li>Difficulty to create inefficient processing pipelines</li>
      <li>Control over processing speed (real-time or faster than real-time)</li>
      <li>Stream processing (as opposed to processing of entire files)</li>
      <li>Processing should not de-synchronize media streams</li>
    </ul>
  </div><div role='region'><p>If existing solutions are not efficient enough, what would make media processing efficient?</p>
<p>It essentially boils down to sizes.</p>
<p>To give you a rough idea, a single video frame in a full HD video weighs about 24MB, so processing a full HD video in real time means processing about 600MB of raw data per second.</p>
<p>Any efficient solution should avoid having to manipulate or copy bytes around, while allowing to leverage the CPU, the GPU, <a class=dfn>WebAssembly</a>, Machine Learning hardware, while also giving some knobs to control the processing speed and, last but not least, while also keeping related tracks synchronized!</p>
<p>That's a lot of requirements and the list is not even exhaustive.</p>
<p>That typically explains why decoded media has remained opaque until now.</p>
<p>It is hard to expose decoded media on the Web!</p></div><div class="slide" id="webcodecs" role="region" aria-label="Slide 15 of 18">
    <h1>WebCodecs</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Efficient access to built-in (software and hardware) media encoders/decoders</li>
      <li>Exposes needed media processing hooks</li>

  </div><div role='region'><p>It is hard, but it is not impossible.</p>
<p>The <a class=dfn>WebCodecs</a> API, initially proposed by Google, aims at providing access to built-in media encoders and decoders.</p>
<p>As a by-product, the API exposes decoded frames, allowing applications to hook into the output of the API to process these frames.</p>
<p>Note that the API does not take care of the mux/demux operations, which will have to be done by the application through some JavaScript or <a class=dfn>WebAssembly</a> code.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be a problem in practice, these operations are not really heavy on the CPU.</p></div><div class="slide" id="webcodecs-status" role="region" aria-label="Slide 16 of 18">
    <h1>WebCodecs — status</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Interfaces being shaped as this talk is recorded</li>
      <li>Lots of open questions, e.g. around integration with other specs such as:
        <ul>
          <li>WebAssembly</li>
          <li>MSE</li>

      <li>Incubation in <abbr title="Web Platform Incubator Community Group">WICG</abbr>, potential deliverable for Media <abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr></li>
    </ul>
  </div><div role='region'><p>The API is very much in flux, so it's hard to assess anything on <a class=dfn>WebCodecs</a> for now.</p>
<p>There are a number of open questions, starting with “how can <a class=dfn>WebCodecs</a> be integrated with other specs?</p>
<p>”.</p>
<p><a class=dfn>WebAssembly</a>, MSE, <a class=dfn>WebRTC</a>, <a class=dfn>WebXR</a> for rendering video in immersive contexts.</p>
<p>Well, and of course, the integration question also exists for machine learning APIs.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the <a class=dfn>WebRTC</a> Working Group has started to work <a class=dfn>WebRTC</a> Insertable Media using Streams that should eventually build on top of <a class=dfn>WebCodecs</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, it seems worth noting that <a class=dfn>WebCodecs</a> is not based on WHATWG Streams.</p>
<p>That was the initial goal, but it turned out to be very difficult.</p>
<p>So having a way to process WHATWG Streams does not necessarily mean that it will be de facto possible to process media streams.</p>
<p>Incubation takes place in the Web Platform Incubator Community Group.</p>
<p>The Media Working Group may adopt and standardize the proposal once it's ready.</p></div><div class="slide" id="other" role="region" aria-label="Slide 17 of 18">
    <h1>Other media features and specs that may impact processing</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Codec switching in MSE</li>
      <li><code>HTMLVideoElement.requestVideoFrameCallback()</code></li>
      <li>Immersive videos: 360°, volumetric, 3D</li>
      <li>Media Timed Events</li>
      <li>Encrypted media</li>
    </ul>
    <p>See the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/media/">Overview of Media Technologies for the Web</a> document for details</p>
  </div><div role='region'><p>Before I conclude, I'd like to raise a few other media technologies and proposals that may or may not affect the way processing gets done in the future.</p>
<p>For instance, the Media Working Group standardizes a codec switching feature for MSE, for instance to allow to insert an ad which may be in low resolution in the middle of a 4K video.</p>
<p>How would such a switch affect processing?</p>
<p>In some “processing” scenarios, all that may be required is rendering an overlay on top of a video without touching the video per se.</p>
<p>That is precisely what the HTMLVideoElement.requestVideoFrameCallback proposal is offering.</p>
<p>How does that affect everything that I presented so far?</p>
<p>Flat videos are no longer the only videos in town.</p>
<p>Other types of videos get rendered for VR/AR and more immersive experiences.</p>
<p>This includes 360 videos, volumetric videos, and more generally 3D playback experiences.</p>
<p>How does processing apply to these cases?</p>
<p>Also, I have only focused on audio and video tracks, but media content also contains events tracks that are more and more used to control the playback experience.</p>
<p>Media industries are putting a lot of efforts these days to standardize solutions to expose media timed events to applications.</p>
<p>The generic idea is to rely on the user agent to do the work.</p>
<p>If <a class=dfn>WebCodecs</a> requires applications to demux media content themselves, then what happens to events tracks?</p>
<p>One final note on encrypted media.</p>
<p>In general, the goal there is to hide the bytes from the applications, so encrypted media is typically not a good candidate for application-controlled processing operations.</p>
<p>There may still be scenarios where the ability to process encrypted media in a separate sandbox could be useful.</p>
<p>So, something that could be worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>All these features and others are mentioned in the Overview of Media Technologies for the Web, which I invite you to take a peak at.</p></div><div class="slide" id="conclusion" role="region" aria-label="Slide 18 of 18">
