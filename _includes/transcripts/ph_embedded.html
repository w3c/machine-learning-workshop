<p>I don't know much about it.</p>
<p>I'm certainly not an expert.</p>
<p>I am here to talk about JavaScript, specifically JavaScript beyond the web platform.</p>
<p>I have some experience there, having delivered my first embedded consumer product powered by JavaScript over a dozen years ago.</p>
<p>I am co-founder of Moddable Tech, creators of XS, the only modern JavaScript engine for resource constrained devices.</p>
<p>I am also chair of Ecma <a class=dfn>TC53</a>, the ECMAScript Modules for Embedded Systems standards committee.</p>
<p><a class=dfn>TC53</a> is defining standard JavaScript APIs for low level device operations -- digital, serial, network sockets.</p>
<p>From there, we are building up to sensors, displays, and more.</p>
<p>Our work allows devices to boot to JavaScript, putting scripts in complete control of the device.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 3 of 11" id="slide-3" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=3"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=3">Slide 3</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>This workshop is about Machine Learning APIs in JavaScript in the browser.</p>
<p>I'm here to explore how it might be extended to low cost, resource constrained embedded devices.</p>
<p>That would be a big win because the web is just part of the world of digital devices.</p>
<p>If developers could share their Machine Learning knowledge, experience, and even code across more devices, that can only accelerate availability of products that benefit users.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 4 of 11" id="slide-4" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=4"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=4">Slide 4</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>Before going further I should explain what I mean by a low cost, resource constrained embedded device.</p>
<p>You might have in mind a Raspberry Pi, an inexpensive Linux computer used in some embedded systems.</p>
<p>I have something much more constrained in mind, something that can't run Linux or Node.</p>
<p>My favorite example is the ESP8266 from Espressif, a $1 module that includes a CPU, some RAM, Wi-Fi, and flash storage.</p>
<p>Moddable runs modern JavaScript -- the ECMAScript 2020 standard -- on these.</p>
<p>For about another dollar, you can get the ESP32 with 4 times more memory, two CPU cores that run three times as fast, and Bluetooth LE. While these devices may not be capable of much Machine Learning, take a look at their big brother.</p>
<p>The i.MX 8M Plus from NXP has a hardware Neural Processing Unit (NPU) that runs up to 2.25 TOPS.</p>
<p>The goal is to move more Machine Learning processing to the edge.</p>
<p>While the i.MX 8M Plus is a relatively high-end embedded processor, NXP has stated their intention to bring similar capabilities to lower cost components.</p>
<p>Other silicon manufacturers are adding hardware acceleration for Machine Learning to their product lines.</p>
<p>We can safely assume there will be Machine Learning hardware accelerators in the embedded silicon that powers IoT products.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 5 of 11" id="slide-5" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=5"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=5">Slide 5</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>But, what APIs will developers use to access it?</p>
<p>If history is any guide, each silicon manufacturer will have their own API.</p>
<p>Determined developers will use these vendor-specific native APIs directly, sacrificing portability.</p>
<p>Some de-facto APIs may emerge, perhaps commercially or through open source, that some silicon manufacturers will grudgingly support.</p>
<p>What about JavaScript?</p>
<p>While these devices can run JavaScript, they often cannot run the JavaScript APIs used on the web because these devices typically have around 1% of the memory and CPU power of a web host.</p>
<p>Web APIs are designed to be powerful, complete, and convenient.</p>
<p>That's great for computer and mobile, but doesn't migrate to embedded.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 6 of 11" id="slide-6" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=6"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=6">Slide 6</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>Two patterns and one anti-pattern have emerged from my work with JavaScript on embedded systems that may be relevant for bridging Machine Learning JavaScript APIs between the web and embedded systems.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 7 of 11" id="slide-7" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=7"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=7">Slide 7</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>In some cases, it is practical to use the same JavaScript API on both web and embedded devices.</p>
<p>The W3C Sensor APIs are a good example.</p>
<p>They give access to sensors in a phone such as the accelerometer and light meter.</p>
<p>The APIs are very simple, making it practical to implement them on resource constrained embedded systems.</p>
<p>In fact, for embedded system uses it turns out the W3C Sensor APIs are too simple.</p>
<p>They do not provide the ability to configure the sensors, manage energy use, or access manufacturer specific capabilities that many embedded products require.</p>
<p>So, <a class=dfn>TC53</a> designed a lower level sensor driver that provides all the needed features.</p>
<p>We intentionally designed the <a class=dfn>TC53</a> sensor driver so it would be straightforward to implement the <a class=dfn>W3C Sensor API</a> using <a class=dfn>TC53</a> sensor drivers.</p>
<p>For example, no mapping of sensor data value is required -- the <a class=dfn>TC53</a> sensor drivers normatively adopt the W3C Sensor values.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 8 of 11" id="slide-8" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=8"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=8">Slide 8</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>In other cases, the JavaScript API from the web is impractical on an embedded device.</p>
<p>The Serial API in Chrome is a good example.</p>
<p>Nearly every embedded device has a serial connection and there's nothing fundamentally different about a serial between a computer and an embedded device.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because Chrome's Serial API is designed to be convenient to use on the web platform, it makes extensive use of asynchronous promises and powerful (but heavy) streams.</p>
<p><a class=dfn>TC53</a>'s Serial API provides similar capabilities through a much smaller and lighter API.</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary differences, <a class=dfn>TC53</a> adopted the naming conventions of Chrome where practical.</p>
<p>What's particularly interesting is that we found it found was possible to implement the <a class=dfn>TC53</a> Serial API using the Chrome Serial API -- effectively emulating the embedded JavaScript API in the browser.</p>
<p>This might feel a bit upside-down, but it provides a single Serial API for both the web and embedded devices, allowing increased code sharing.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 9 of 11" id="slide-9" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=9"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=9">Slide 9</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>One word of warning.</p>
<p>I would caution against the anti-pattern of creating a “light” version of any web API to use on embedded.</p>
<p>“Light” versions are subsets of a full API.</p>
<p>They are almost always painful to use for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>First, developers expect the full API, and are annoyed as they discover the differences.</p>
<p>Second, because the “Light” API looks about the same, developers try to use it to perform the same operations as the full API, but on less powerful devices.</p>
<p>The results are always disappointing.</p>
<p>It is better to have a dedicated embedded API and a dedicated web API that share concepts and operations to the extent practical.</p>
<p>That gives authors of libraries and framework a foundation to build APIs that support both for specific domains or to emulate the embedded API on the web, as we've done with Serial.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 10 of 11" id="slide-10" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=10"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/ph_embedded.pdf#page=10">Slide 10</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>To close, I hope this W3C initiative will consider including low-cost, resource constrained devices in its scope of work in some way.</p>
