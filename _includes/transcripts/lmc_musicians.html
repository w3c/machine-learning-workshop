<p>Although it has a lot to offer these communities, their skill sets and requirements often diverge from more conventional machine learning use cases.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 3 of 21" id="slide-3" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=3"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=3">Slide 3</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>During this short talk, we will address three key requirements when designing for these users.</p>
<p>Primarily we're describing machine learning programs that run in real time.</p>
<p>That is, they receive rich data from microphones, cameras, external sensors and controllers in real time, whilst concurrently running inference and generating media output within the browser without audible and visible interference.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 4 of 21" id="slide-4" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=4"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=4">Slide 4</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>Secondly, we focus on supporting the needs of end user machine learning, where end users themselves collect data and train and evaluate models on their own browsers.</p>
<p>This is a distinct use case to other web projects that seek to provide pre-trained models for using and generating media in the browser.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 5 of 21" id="slide-5" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=5"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=5">Slide 5</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>Thirdly, we support an iterative approach to training and evaluating in real time or near real time feedback loop.</p>
<p>This is sometimes known as interactive machine learning.</p>
<p>It allows for users from a wide range of technical, nontechnical, and creative backgrounds to develop interactive systems with complex media data that they'd have struggled to program by hand, perhaps also with behaviors they wouldn't have thought to program by hand.</p>
<p>Beyond this it's been useful for working with children with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>
<p>For example, the Sound Control project, and in gaming in Unity, you can check out the InteractML project.</p>
<p>This approach to machine learning is also excellent, in the educational settings.</p>
<p>Working with interactive media can be a really accessible stepping stone to data literacy.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 6 of 21" id="slide-6" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=6"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=6">Slide 6</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>So why would we want to do this in a browser?</p>
<p>Building browser based tools is useful because they require little of the installation and dependencies that plenty other data science endeavors.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 7 of 21" id="slide-7" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=7"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=7">Slide 7</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>Additionally, JavaScript is a fast growing language with low barriers to entry.</p>

<p>As such, we see in-browser solutions for training, data storage and inference highly, highly, highly preferable.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 12 of 21" id="slide-12" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=12"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=12">Slide 12</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>So, with these clear advantages to developing end user machine learning tools in the browser, we also seek to address the non-trivial technical challenges of connecting media and sensory inputs from a variety of sources, running these alongside potentially computationally expensive feature extractors, also running lightweight machine learning models and generating audio and visual output, all in real time, all concurrently, all without interference.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 13 of 21" id="slide-13" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=13"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=13">Slide 13</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>For example, we might want to use the body pics feature extractor to get a skeleton data from webcam, and use a regression model to control multiple synthesizers.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 14 of 21" id="slide-14" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=14"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=14">Slide 14</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>Alternatively, we might want to use a neural network to generate frames of spectral data, and then turn this into audio.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 15 of 21" id="slide-15" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=15"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=15">Slide 15</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>Whilst technologies like AudioWorklets address this to some extent, and we welcome the recent introduction of it into Firefox, there remains some issues with implementation and adoption.</p>
<p>For example, issues with garbage collection created by the worker thread messaging system, caused wide-scale disruption to many developers using AudioWorklets, and was only really addressed by a bring buffer solution that developers had to integrate themselves outside of the core API.</p>
<p>At the time, because of this bug in chromium, there were two to three months over the winter of 2019, where running computationally heavy machine learning processes and generating audio at the same time caused these horrible pops and crackles and stuff.</p>
<p>And because AudioWorklets was only implemented in one browser, that's Chrome, we were unable to offer our users any alternatives.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 16 of 21" id="slide-16" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=16"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=16">Slide 16</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>We welcome the efficiency and usability increases to in-browser computation made available through the <a class=dfn>WebGPU</a> API. It's crucial that it's adopted as a standard across all browsers, and that the API itself and any machine learning libraries using it take real time media into account when implementing themselves.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 17 of 21" id="slide-17" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=17"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=17">Slide 17</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>Finally, although the capabilities of in-browser media creation are expanding, the majority of practitioners remain using software tools outside of the browser to generate sound and visuals.</p>
<p>Until browser support for media generation is improved to allow an ecosystem of tools similar to that existing outside of the browser, this is going to continue to be the case.</p>
<p>So, serving the dual purposes of getting data into the browser to build data sets to train models, and outputting controlled data generated by machine learning models, we seek to further increase the adoption of connectivity technologies, such as Web MIDI and <a class=dfn>WebBLE</a>.</p>
<p>The WorldWide Developer Conference in 2020 actually sort of Safari disavow both of these as a fingerprinting security precaution.</p>
<p>Safari has also made little suggestion it's going to adopt the AudioWorklets infrastructure.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 18 of 21" id="slide-18" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=18"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=18">Slide 18</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>So, to wrap it up, we seek to prioritize accessible machine learning.</p>
<p>There's a focus on end users building their own datasets dynamically and training their own models on the fly, in conjunction with real time media analysis and generation.</p>
<p>There's a community of developers, researchers, educators, and creatives, who are able to produce software and resources to enable end users who wanna use machine learning in this manner.</p>
<p>However, we're looking at the W3C, and developers of web browsers to allow the performance and the connectivity to make these techniques viable, sustainable, and accessible, and to just keep us in mind, and this particular use case in mind when defining standards or choosing to adopt standards.</p></div><div class="slide" role='region' aria-label="Slide 19 of 21" id="slide-19" data-fmt="pdf" data-src="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=19"><noscript><a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/lmc_musicians.pdf#page=19">Slide 19</a></noscript></div><div role='region'><p>We'd like to call on those watching this video with an interest in the web and machine learning to actively work to uplift black voices within the research community.</p>
