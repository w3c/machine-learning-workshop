New silicon for embedded systems is beginning to include hardware to accelerate ML, bringing ML to edge devices. These embedded systems are capable of running the same modern JavaScript used on the web. Would it be possible for the embedded systems to be coded in JavaScript in a way that is compatible with the ML APIs of the web?</p><p>This talk will briefly present two examples of JavaScript APIs developed for the web to support hardware features -- the W3C Sensor API and the Chrome Serial API. It will describe how each has been bridged to the embedded world in a different way -- perhaps suggesting a model for how W3C ML JavaScript APIs can bridge the embedded and browser worlds as well.</p></dd></dl></details>
