He got his Ph.D. degree in Jun. 2017 from Peking University. His research interests lie in mobile computing, Web systems, and services computing. He has published several papers on WWW and ACM Trans on the Web. Recently he focuses on how to enable browsers to support deep learning tasks better.</dd><dt>Abstract</dt><dd>Recently, several JavaScript-based deep learning frameworks have emerged, making it possible to perform deep learning tasks directly in browsers. However, little is known on what and how well we can do with these frameworks for deep learning in browsers. In this talk, I’ll present our recent empirical study of deep learning in browsers. We survey 7 most popular JavaScript-based deep learning frameworks, investigating to what extent deep learning tasks have been supported in browsers so far. Then we measure the performance of different frameworks when running different deep learning tasks. Finally, we dig out the performance gap between deep learning in browsers and on native platforms by comparing the performance of TensorFlow.js and TensorFlow in Python. Our findings could help application developers, deep-learning framework vendors and browser vendors to improve the efficiency of deep learning in browsers. The content of this talk was published in WWW 2019.</dd></dl></details>
