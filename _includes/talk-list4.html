Numerous stories of the automation and amplification of existing discrimination and inequity are emerging, as more and more critical decisions and functions are handed over to machine learning systems. There is a growing movement to tackle non-representative data and to prevent the introduction of human biases into machine learning algorithms.</p><p>However, these efforts are not addressing a fundamental characteristic of data driven decisions that presents significant risk if you have a disability. Even if there is full proportional representation and even if all human bias is removed from AI systems, the systems will favour the majority and dominant patterns. This has implications for individuals and groups that are outliers, small minorities or highly heterogeneous. The only common characteristic of disability is sufficient difference from the average such that most systems are a misfit and present a barrier. Machine learning requires large data sets. Many people with disabilities represent a data set of one. Decisions based on population data will decide against small minorities and for the majority. The further you are from average the harder it will be to train machine learning systems to serve your needs. To add insult to injury, if you are an outlier and highly unique, privacy protections won’t work for you and you will be most vulnerable to data abuse and misuse.</p><p>This presentation will:<ul><li>       outline the risks and opportunities presented by machine learning systems;<li>       address strategies to mitigate the risks; and<li>       discuss steps needed to support decisions that do not discriminate against outliers and small minorities.</ul><p>The benefits for innovation and the well-being of society as a whole will also be discussed</dd></dl></details>

However, machine translation has always been treated as a computationally heavy problem and as such is usually delivered to the end user via online services such as Google Translate, which may not be appropriate for sensitive content. We present a privacy focussed machine translation system that runs locally on the user's machine and is accessible through a Firefox browser extension. The translation models used are just 16MB and translation speed is high enough for a seamless user experience even on laptops from 2012.</dd></dl></details>

Currently, he holds a Post Doctoral position at the Embodied AudioVisual Interaction Group, Goldsmiths, University of London, where he is also an Associate Lecturer. He is also lead developer on the <a href='https://mimicproject.com'>MIMIC platform</a> and accompanying <a href='https://mimicproject.com/guides/learner'>Learner.js</a> and <a href='https://mimicproject.com/guides/maxi-instrument'>MaxiInstrument.js</a> libraries</dd><dt>Abstract</dt><dd>Over the past 2 years, as part of the RCUK AHRC funded <a href='http://mimicproject.com/'>MIMIC project</a> we have provided platforms and libraries for musicians and artists to use, perform and collaborate online using machine learning. Although it has a lot to offer these communities, their skill sets and requirements often diverge from more conventional machine learning use cases. For example, requirements for dynamic provision of data and on-the-fly training in the browser raises challenges with performance, connectivity and storage. We seek to address the non trivial challenges of connecting inputs from a variety of sources, running potentially computationally expensive feature extractors alongside lightweight machine learning models and generating audio and visual output, in real time, without interference. Whilst technologies like AudioWorklets addresses this to some extent, there remain issues with implementation, documentation and adoption (currently limited to Chrome). For example, issues with <a href='https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1033493#c42'>garbage collection (created by the worker thread messaging system)</a> caused wide scale disruption to many developers using AudioWorklets and was only addressed by a <a href='https://github.com/padenot/ringbuf.js'>ringbuffer solution</a> that developers must integrate outside of the core API. We are also keen to ensure the <a href='https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/'>WebGPU API</a>  takes realtime media into consideration as it is introduced. Our talk will cover both the user’s perspectives as uncovered by our user-centered research and a developer’s perspective from the technical challenges we have faced developing tools to meet the needs of these users in both creative and educational settings.</dd></dl></details>
