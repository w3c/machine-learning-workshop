NNAPI is designed to provide a base layer of functionality for higher-level machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow Lite and Caffe2, that build and train neural networks. The API is available on all Android devices running Android 8.1 (API level 27) or higher. Based on an app’s requirements and the hardware capabilities on an Android device, NNAPI can efficiently distribute the computation workload across available on-device processors, including dedicated neural network hardware (NPUs and TPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and digital signal processors (DSPs).</dd></dl></details>

This talk will describe Intel’s oneAPI initiative, which is an open ecosystem for heterogeneous computing that supports high-performance data analytics, machine learning and other workloads. A key component of this is Data Parallel C++, which is based on C++17 and Khronos SYCL and supports direct programming of CPU, GPU and FPGA platforms. We will describe how oneAPI and Data Parallel C++ can be used to build high-performance applications for a range of devices.</dd></dl></details>

The other is a lightweight collaborative DNN over cloud, edge and devices, which provides a collaborative mechanism with the edge cloud for accurate compensation.</dd></dl></details>

In our talk we will present a browser-based collaborative learning approach for running data analysis services on peer-to-peer networks of devices. Our platform is developed in Javascript, supports modularization of services, model training and usage on devices (tensorflow.js), sensor communication (mqtt), and peer-to-peer communication (WebRTC) with role-based access-control (oauth 2.0).</dd></dl></details>
