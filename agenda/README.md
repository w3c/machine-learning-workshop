ℹ️ [Protecting ML models #67](https://github.com/w3c/machine-learning-workshop/issues/67) - @jasonmayes @tidoust @pyu10055 @jbingham
- ❓ Some ML providers need to ensure their ML models cannot be extracted from a browser app.
- ✔️ Proposal: Investigate existing access control mechanisms for video, learnings from 3D assets.

ℹ️ [In-browser training #82](https://github.com/w3c/machine-learning-workshop/issues/82) - @irealva @hapticdata @cynthia
- ❓ The current in-browser efforts are focused on inference rather than training.
- ✔️ Proposal: Understand successful real-world usages (e.g. Teachable Machine) and target transfer learning as the initial training use case for related browser API work.

 [Training across devices #83](https://github.com/w3c/machine-learning-workshop/issues/83) - @wmaass @Nov1102 @EmmaNingMS @zolkis @jaykishigami
- ❓ Understand the role of edge computing in training and interactions with the web platform.
- ✔️ Proposal: Work with Web & Networks IG to understand edge computing use cases and ensure input from ML usages is considered.

## Extending the web foundations for ML

ℹ️ [Targeting WASI-NN and WebNN together #96](https://github.com/w3c/machine-learning-workshop/issues/96) - @mehmetoguzderin @mingqiusun @abrown
- ❓ Should libraries for browsers and/or Wasm execution environments be able to target WebNN and WASI-NN together?
- ✔️ Proposal: TBD

ℹ️ [Heterogeneous parallel computing for the web #92](https://github.com/w3c/machine-learning-workshop/issues/92) - @jeffhammond @Kangz
- ❓ How do the heterogeneous parallel computing abstractions fit in with the web platform?
- ✔️ Proposal: TBD
