<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Last live session of this series of sessions
on Web and Machine Learning. [Anssi going through logistics slides:
use the "raise hand" feature on Zoom to queue, there's a Slack
channel, minute notes on Google Docs, CEPC!].</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Today's topics are: user's perspective, and
conclusions and next steps. I will need to timebox discussions
actively! Web & ML for all includes bias and model transparency,
speech recognition, etc. Next steps topic is to discuss what we
have learned, what we still need to explore, and what we think next
steps should be from a standardization perspective: incubations or
standardization opportunities.</p>

and model transparency #108</a></h3>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-55"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Model bias impacts minorities and
underrepresented groups. We had a good discussion on GitHub around
this. A proposal emerged that we should explore the role of
machine-readable Model Cards to bring more transparency. Inviting
Jutta to present.</p>
<p><cite>Jutta:</cite> Revealing where the data gaps are. Potential
to reveal even more things that are expressed in the Model Cards,
including what proxies have been used, what was the original
context of the ML model. I see that it could definitely help
assessing what bias may exist in the model, where it would be
inappropriate to apply this model. As I expressed in GitHub, my
concerns about AI and population-based decisions is that the issue
goes even further. We're using AI/ML to optimize our current
practices. That means that we are amplifying biases that already
exist, even before AI existed. The underlying assumption about
quantified models is that we are basing decisions based on the
majority. In essence, we're reducing diversity, meaning that we
cannot enforce diversity in an ethical way. My comment within
GitHub was about it being an issue about personalized systems.
These systems tend to be very difficult to train if you are very
unique. The further you are from the average of a particular
dataset, the harder it is.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Your lightning talk was very inspirational.
A lot to unpack there. I would like to invite John Rochford. How
does that resonate with you?</p>
<p><cite>John:</cite> Jutta is, as always, eloquent in describing
the problem. In my mind, unless we are inclusive in the creation of
our datasets and the development of our technologies, we are going
to produce ML models that are not trusted by people, and not useful
to people, because they don't include all people. I think that when
we are talking about who these people are, it's been my long
experience as a developer&nbsp;that we don't even think, say, about
people who are not like us. Very common not to consider people with
disabilities. Disability is the only minority group that is
represented everywhere (rich/poor, regardless of location,
majority/minority). What I'm saying is: if we can solve problems
for people with disabilities, then we can solve them for
everyone.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> It actually benefits all, I like this
perspective. Let's look at proposals. It looks very pragmatic.
Maybe the browser could surface that info to the user. That seemed
to resonate with people. What do you think?</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> Both Jutta and John have been talking about
problems beyond transparency. I don't have a good short-term
solution for that. Starting with transparency seems like a good
first step.</p>
<p><cite>Jutta:</cite> I think this is a great step forward (or
beginning). Some form of impact assessment would be useful as well.
It would be a living document where insights about the model could
be added.</p>
<p><cite>Oguz:</cite> Making more APIs available with data URLs
helps minorities too. Because it is easier to deliver apps using
data URLs to environments where delivering apps can be a subject of
censorship.</p>
<div class="chat"><h3>Comments on Chat</h3>
<p>Christine Runnegar: +1 to what Dom says, transparency is only
  the first step</p>
</div>
<h3><a href=
"https://github.com/w3c/machine-learning-workshop/issues/99">Speech
    recognition privacy issues and solutions #99</a></h3>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-56"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Standardization of speech recognition has
been challenging because of privacy issues. Let's discuss how to
address obstacles.</p>
<p><cite>Kelly:</cite> In terms of the current specification,
issues are around fingerprinting, starting with synthesis.
Different OSes have different speech synthesis engines, and you can
derive fine-grained fingerprinting information from that. Other
issues involved in terms of speech recognition too. Partial
implementations of the speech API use some server-based speech
recognition. When is that done? How long do they retain the data?
Question of privacy, your data may be sitting in a server
somewhere. You don't really have any control about how long your
audio data is retained, no way to delete it either. Someone in the
background may also be saying something private that gets recorded
too and stored on the server. Client-side speech recognition is
getting popular. It does have some advantages, but makes it harder
to improve your engine without data to train it on.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Should we, in the specification, allow the
user to indicate that they agree to use the feature provided that
data does not leave the browser? Would that help with interop? Is
it a reasonable approach to this problem?</p>
<p><cite>Kelly:</cite> It would be a welcomed change. My gut
feeling is that, if we have a flag, then implementers will just
disable the feature entirely if server-side is not allowed.</p>
<p><cite>Christine:</cite> Thank you, Kelly, for the introduction
on privacy considerations you've identified. Would there be any
appetite for the Web Speech API to be specified solely as a
client-side API? I'm worried about "cheating"</p>
<p><cite>Kelly:</cite> At least from Mozilla perspective, there
would be appetite for that. That means that we don't have to
maintain servers, worry about server uptimes and the like.</p>
<p><cite>Jutta:</cite> I was wondering whether we could take a
broader approach. We see what has happened with GDPR. One of the
things that we've been exploring is user preference to rollback
this all-or-nothing where you get the service or not. We've been
looking at the possibility to negotiate the use of data where you,
as a user, get to say what uses of the data you agree with. Service
providers would need to state what uses it will use the data
for.</p>
<p><cite>John:</cite> That information has to be written simply for
everyone to be able to understand it.</p>
<p><cite>Jutta:</cite> Right. It would mean greater education for
users to understand what risks and opportunities</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> There have been attempts in the past to do
that. None of these attempts have been a real success, partly
because of the difficulty to reduce the dimensions to something
that people may understand and relate to, and that would still
match what service providers may be doing. Might still be worth
looking at again. One of the problems you highlighted is that the
API has been developed, shipped, and it hasn't received the sort of
horizontal reviews that specs usually get on their way to
standardization. Client-side vs. Server-side would have arised.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> I'm hearing that no-one is opposing this
proposal. We need a champion. The spec has been lingering for about
10 years already.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> For anyone passionate about fixing that API,
please get in touch! The more, the merrier, and the better the
API!</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Clear need for the API, great
conclusion!</p>
<div class="chat"><h3>Comments on Chat</h3>
<p>Ken Kahn: Another advantage of client-side speech recognition is
for people with poor quality network connections (common in some
parts of the world)</p>
<p>Zoltan Kis: Certainly all the general AI related privacy
concerns apply to Web ML. But could we name a few web-specific
threats and mitigations to ML? (can't speak, just take the question
if there is time).</p>
<p>Wendy Seltzer: &nbsp;There's also a challenge of getting the
incentives aligned right in policy negotiations.</p>
<p>Jutta Treviranus: Another approach is cooperative data trusts —
  data governed and kept by a cooperative of the users</p>

<h3><a href=
"https://github.com/w3c/machine-learning-workshop/issues/90">Designing
privacy-preserving ML APIs #90</a></h3>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-57"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> How to ensure the tight feedback loop and
productive joint effort between ML ecosystem and privacy experts?
Proposal is to organize an early review of WebNN API by the Privacy
Interest Group. WebNN is a concrete proposal, hence the reason why
we propose to start with it.</p>
<p><cite>Phil:</cite> My perspective has been from a developer
point of view. Doing mass aggregation of data. Privacy-preserving
solutions won't work if developers need to put additional efforts
into it. That ties directly with tools that developers use such as
Tensorflow.js. I'd like to make sure that defaults are good, as
opposed to developers having to do extra work. Reach out to those
working on cloud-based architectures.</p>
<p><cite>Kenneth:</cite> We're trying to do client-side machine
translation because most of the Web is not in your language. This
can be a browser extension, or it would run natively, but you'd
have to download an Exe. To run on the Web, we have a performance
issue. When we sit on top of WebAssembly, we lose 8bit integers,
SIMD, etc. I don't really care what multiply leaks in terms of
privacy because I already do it as part of the extension. Another
angle is that there are lots of languages, possibly specialized,
for which we don't have enough data. We take data wherever we can
find it. Speaking a rare language is not a disability, but it is a
community enablement that we should allow.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> If the extension is a use case for the spec,
we could design the API for that use case. No special treatment for
Web APIs for the extensions case, right?</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> Right. The context of special privileged
runtimes is something that comes back very often in standardization
discussions.</p>
<p><cite>Jutta:</cite> I really appreciate the discussion of a
tool-centric approach. That matches the way we would approach it
from an accessibility perspective. There is an issue with all of
the privacy strategies that exist. If you have very specific needs,
then the noise that gets added to anonymize things may also remove
the specific needs that you had. There is a tension here. I'm not
sure that we have as yet found an approach to that. Anonymous
stream systems tend not to survive.</p>
<h3><a href=
"https://github.com/w3c/machine-learning-workshop/issues/109">Building
an extensible web platform for ML, one abstraction at a time
#109</a></h3>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-58"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Simply put, the proposal is to work on a
charter for standardizing the WebNN API, as a first pragmatic step
focused on low-level capabilities. Use of WebGL, WebNN, etc.
require domain-specific knowledge. Libraries have emerged, such as
Tensorflow.js, to provide higher-level abstractions. There are
other high-level APIs: Web Speech API, Shape detection API. These
proposals have been stuck in the incubation phase, in part because
of lack of interoperability and privacy issues. I would like to
invite Chai to give us a more complete picture.</p>
<p><cite>Chai:</cite> I'm speaking from the OS point of view. We
have seen tons of innovation in the hardware space, surfacing to
system APIs. I think that this is the right level to work on the
Web. WebNN would be the&nbsp;conduit of ML on the Web now and in
the future. I'm supportive of progressing WebNN. There may be
worries about lack of standards on ML model formats. My perspective
is that developers will progressively explore and settle down on
formats over time. As far as I can tell, no scenario is blocked by
the fact that the model only works in one format. The benefit of
connecting at the ML level instead of going below that is the
possibility to address issues raised during this workshop,
including privacy ones. How to connect the front-end and back-end
technologies together, that's the first step.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Queue is open for discussion. Silence is
consent.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> I was part of formulating that proposal
because what we heard through presentations is that WebNN is at the
sweet spot of granularity to make ML efficient today. There are
many things that are beyond WebNN that also need further work, but
the clear message is that WebNN is a critical piece, a tiny piece,
and in a good enough shape to transition to standardization.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> I hear agreement!</p>

<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusions & Next Steps</h2>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-60"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> [showing architectural diagram]. Top layer,
specific ML scenarios, connecting to JS frameworks, connected to
low-level Web APIs such as WebGL/WebGPU, WebNN, WebAssembly. Below
that, there is the system level. At the lowest level, there are
hardware considerations. What we explored is that there is rapid
innovation in model architecture and format. We also learned that
there is good per-platform interoperability, e.g. on Windows. At
the lowest level, we learned that there is growing diversity of
  hardware architecture.</p>

<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-61"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite>We learned that browser-learned ML inference
has a key role to play. We learned that a graph-based API layered
over OS APIs is a key primitive for efficient ML inference. ML
model formats are evolving fast, as Chai just raised a couple of
minutes ago. There may be room for a format-agnostic model loader
API, and there is already incubation in that space. We learned that
efficient ML processing of media requires improvements of the
processing pipeline. Last, we learned about layering conformance
  testing.</p>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-62"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> We also learned that JS and WASM need some
upgrades to cater optimally for ML in browsers. We need to keep an
eye on ML training. Scaling up ML via browsers creates risks of
scaling up bias issues. That's an overall summary of key learnings
from this workshop. The floor is open for discussions.</p>
<p><cite>Kenneth:</cite> I don't really understand the conflation
of OS with toolkit. Arguably, that's a weakness rather than a
strength, right?</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Right, this is an oversimplification. The
message is "any Web API that we develop needs to work on any system
and hardware".</p>
<p><cite>Olek:</cite> Small note about this architecture slide.
There are things that go beyond use cases, such as Safari doing ML
for tracking protection. It's important when we design APIs that
inputs may be different to all of the use cases that appear
here.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Yes, I encourage people to watch your
  talk!</p>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-63"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Let's move to what we still need to figure
out. [reading out slide]. E.g. there were concerns raised about the
power consumption of ML inference. How can the APIs be used in non
browser environments, such as Node.js. Integration between
high-level APIs (Web Speech API) and low-level WebNN API. Could
developers propose their own models instead of using the one
proposed by the browser or the OS? Awareness of bias is what we
discussed today. Finally, how important is it for ML that WebGPU
provides ML-useful optimizations? See e.g. talk from Oguz.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> My sense from the overall discussions at the
workshop is that we started some really useful, and in some cases
some deep, discussions. The workshop is by no means the end of it.
For those that we've identified as having open questions, my hope
is that we continue the conversations well beyond the workshop. We
will be presenting some of the mechanisms that we can offer. In any
case, we would like to make sure that you can continue to be part
of the discussions in the future.</p>
<p><cite>Jutta:</cite> One addition: How to address the inherent
biases that the current ML systems have. It's not only an issue to
be addressed, but an opportunity to be able to enlarge usefulness
  of models.</p>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-64"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Last 3 things to figure out. What
introspection data on models is needed to cater for progressive
enhancement approaches? What architecture do we need to distribute
ML across multiple devices, including edge computing? Last, does ML
model storage require any specific browser adaptation or would the
File System Access API cover all needs? Any feedback? Please raise
your hand!</p>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-65"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Moving on to incubation steps. Incubation is
pre-standardization, for short. Validate that Model Loader API can
support interoperable deployment of ML. Explore gating access to
compute intensive APIS, which the TAG may be able to drive. Explore
optimizing memory copy across the media pipeline, the Media &
Entertainment IG may be interested in exploring that. Last, explore
machine-readable Model Cards.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> To give some context, for those not involved
in W3C standardization, the way we build them is, before we cast
them in stones, we welcome various ideas, proposals that get
incubated, typically in Community Groups.&nbsp;Anyone can join a
CG. I note that I have suggested that the Media & Entertainment IG
could host the coordination discussion on memory copies, but I
don't think they have committed to it. Anssi started a repository
where technical discussions can be raised. We'll include links in
  the report.</p>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-66"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Moving on to next steps in standardization.
First, we propose to bring WebNN to W3C standardization. There is
already a first draft of a possible charter for a machine learning
WG. Couple of other standardization opportunities: re-invigorate
efforts for JS operators overloading in ECMA TC39. I think we
identified a champion to bump priority of this feature. Another
related effort around Float16 support in JS. We need to liaise with
ECMA on these two latter proposals.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> W3C standardization are for more mature ideas,
the ones we think have a good chance of bringing the right features
to the Web. Formal standardization process for WebNN, where
"formal" means going through a number of steps including horizontal
reviews, and making sure that there is consensus around the various
stakeholders that the API design is the right one. The first formal
step in that process is creating a working group where this
standardization is happening. The charter that we are writing is
defining the scope. If you're interested in making sure that the
standardization goes in the right direction, please consider
reviewing and contributing to the charter, and to the group
  afterwards!</p>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-67"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Moving on to where to follow up. The github
repo of the workshop is open and active for the foreseeable future.
When we see enough momentum on something, we'll move it to the
right place! Input to the proposed charter is welcome, as Dom just
said. There is also a proposed breakout session at the upcoming
virtual TPAC on memory copies. Also, remember that the Web ML CG is
up and running, please join if you haven't done already. Watch out
for the upcoming feedback survey, and reach out to Dom to let us
know whether we should do this type of workshop again in the
future.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> We will be developing a report of this
workshop. What we think we've learned, what next steps we propose,
in addition to the minutes. This could be something easier to
circulate.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> We'll circulate a draft before it gets
  published. Any question or comment about where to follow up?</p>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-68"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Last but not least, I'd like to acknowledge
the effort of various workshop contributors: program committee for
guiding the workshop direction, speakers for providing deep dive
insights, our sponsors for making it possible to organize a
workshop that is free for all to attend. You can now congratulate
yourself. The Web platform is ideally positioned to deliver machine
learning to billions of users across devices and across the globe.
Thank you everyone, hope to see you around!</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> And again, feel free to reach out to me, about
life, the universe and everything. dom@w3.org</p>
