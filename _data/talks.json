      "abstract": "Recently, several JavaScript-based deep learning frameworks have emerged, making it possible to perform deep learning tasks directly in browsers. However, little is known on what and how well we can do with these frameworks for deep learning in browsers. In this talk, I’ll present our recent empirical study of deep learning in browsers. We survey 7 most popular JavaScript-based deep learning frameworks, investigating to what extent deep learning tasks have been supported in browsers so far. Then we measure the performance of different frameworks when running different deep learning tasks. Finally, we dig out the performance gap between deep learning in browsers and on native platforms by comparing the performance of TensorFlow.js and TensorFlow in Python. Our findings could help application developers, deep-learning framework vendors and browser vendors to improve the efficiency of deep learning in browsers. The content of this talk was published in WWW 2019."

Even if there is full proportional representation and even if all human bias is removed from AI systems, the systems will favour the majority and dominant patterns.

The only common characteristic of disability is sufficient difference from the average such that most systems are a misfit and present a barrier. Machine learning requires large data sets. Many people with disabilities represent a data set of one. Decisions based on population data will decide against small minorities and for the majority. The further you are from average the harder it will be to train machine learning systems to serve your needs.

It will focus on the special considerations needed in music & audio applications, the relationship between ML models and Web Audio, and the limitations encountered while combining the two.",

However, browser based support for such systems is spotty or lacking. This talk will be concerned with the industry's ongoing work to bring ML based speech recognition into the browser. It will cover a wide spectrum of topics: the struggle to standardize a browser based API, the privacy questions such an API exposes, the technical details of embedding (or not) an ML based system into the browser, along with many other topics.",

However, machine translation has always been treated as a computationally heavy problem and as such is usually delivered to the end user via online services such as Google Translate, which may not be appropriate for sensitive content. We present a privacy focussed machine translation system that runs locally on the user's machine and is accessible through a Firefox browser extension. The translation models used are just 16MB and translation speed is high enough for a seamless user experience even on laptops from 2012.",

        "abstract": "Over the past 2 years, as part of the RCUK AHRC funded <a href='http://mimicproject.com/'>MIMIC project</a> we have provided platforms and libraries for musicians and artists to use, perform and collaborate online using machine learning. Although it has a lot to offer these communities, their skill sets and requirements often diverge from more conventional machine learning use cases. For example, requirements for dynamic provision of data and on-the-fly training in the browser raises challenges with performance, connectivity and storage. We seek to address the non trivial challenges of connecting inputs from a variety of sources, running potentially computationally expensive feature extractors alongside lightweight machine learning models and generating audio and visual output, in real time, without interference. Whilst technologies like AudioWorklets addresses this to some extent, there remain issues with implementation, documentation and adoption (currently limited to Chrome). For example, issues with <a href='https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1033493#c42'>garbage collection (created by the worker thread messaging system)</a> caused wide scale disruption to many developers using AudioWorklets and was only addressed by a <a href='https://github.com/padenot/ringbuf.js'>ringbuffer solution</a> that developers must integrate outside of the core API. We are also keen to ensure the <a href='https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/'>WebGPU API</a>  takes realtime media into consideration as it is introduced. Our talk will cover both the user’s perspectives as uncovered by our user-centered research and a developer’s perspective from the technical challenges we have faced developing tools to meet the needs of these users in both creative and educational settings.",
