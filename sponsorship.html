    <section>
      <p>W3C is organizing a virtual workshop to  bring together Machine Learning tools and framework providers with Web platform practitioners to enrich the Open Web Platform with better foundations for machine learning. The workshop aims at enabling the sharing of experiences between practitioners in these and related fields, at encouraging discussion about existing gaps in the Open Web Platform that may make some Machine Learning use cases difficult or impossible today, and at exploring what future standards are needed to pave the way for the Web to be one of the major platforms for Machine Learning.</p>

      <p>For more details on the conference, see the <a href="./">Web &amp; Machine Learning Workshop page</a>.</p>

      <p>Sponsoring W3C Workshop on Web &amp; Machine Learning shows leadership and helps move the dialog forward.</p>

        <h3 id="why">Why Sponsor This Workshop?</h3>
        <p>The cost to hold this virtual workshop includes costs for post-processing the pre-recorded talks (captioning, video/slides synchronization, packaging) and other considerations.</p>

        <p>Most of the planning, coordination, agenda building, and writing outcome reports are done for no cost by W3C staff or volunteers. But without sponsorships, W3C cannot hold workshops.</p>

        <p>If you see value in discussing possible standardization of Machine Learning for the Web, and believe it will help your business, sponsoring is the best way to ensure that this conversation happens, and that you are seen as a leader and a forward-looking enabler of the technical evolution of the Web.</p>

        <p>W3C Workshops, meetups, and other events bring you into direct contact with leading Web technology experts: representatives from industry, research, government, and the developer community.</p>
        <p>Whether your interests are focused on a particular topic being discussed by a Working Group, or you wish to reach a diverse international audience setting W3C&#39;s strategic direction, sponsorship helps your organization reach W3C&#39;s engaged participants.</p>
        <p>Sponsorships offset a portion of our meeting costs, so W3C welcomes multiple sponsors for each event. All proposals for sponsorship are subject to W3C approval.</p>
